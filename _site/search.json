With the growing prevalence of cardiovascular diseases worldwide, this dataset provides critical insights into the health profiles, risk factors, and potential triggers associated with heart attacks among two distinct demographics.\n\n\n\n\nAn international media company that publishes weekly content on digital platforms is planning to release articles on the following themes.\nAssuming the role of the graphical editor of the media company, i am tasked to choose one of the theme above (Japan Heart attack) and to prepare data visualisation for the article.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst, write a code chunk to check, install and launch the following R packages:\n\ncorrplot: a graphical display of a correlation matrix\n\n\n\nggiraph for making ‘ggplot’ graphics interactive.\nggplot2: A system for declaratively creating graphics, based on the grammar of graphics.\ntidyverse, a family of modern R packages specially designed to support data science, analysis and communication task including creating static statistical graphs.\nggthemes, Extra themes, geoms, and scales for ggplot2.\npatchwork for combining multiple ggplot2 graphs into one figure.\nggstatsplot is an extension of ggplot2 package for creating graphics with details from statistical tests included in the information-rich plots themselves\nplotly: Create interactive web-based plots using ggplot2 and more\ndplyr: A grammar of data manipulation\n\nThe code chunk below will be used to accomplish the task.\n\npacman::p_load(corrplot, ggiraph, ggplot2, tidyverse, ggthemes, patchwork, ggstatsplot, plotly, dplyr)\n\n\n\n\nFirst by importing the Japan_heart_attack_data set.csv to “Japan”\nUsing the read.csv(path) would allow me to do so.\n\njapan &lt;- read.csv(\"data/japan_heart_attack_dataset.csv\")\n\n\n\n\nIn order to Understand our data, we would need to check what are the column’s title and how many rows we have. To view the data’s information we can use glimpse(data) and summary(data) to do so.\n\nStep 1. Use glimpse to understand the data and data cleaningStep 2. Check for duplicatesStep 3.

Therefore the best chart to use would be a Bar Chart if we want to show the distribution.\n\nheart_attack_bar_plot &lt;- ggplot(japan_cleaned, aes(x = Heart_Attack_Occurrence, fill = Heart_Attack_Occurrence)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  labs(title = \"Distribution of Heart Attack Occurrence\",\n       x = \"Heart Attack Occurrence\",\n       y = \"Number of People\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"#E63946\", \"#457B9D\"))\n\ninteractive_heart_attack_bar &lt;- ggplotly(heart_attack_bar_plot)\n\ninteractive_heart_attack_bar\n\n\n\n\n\nThe distribution of heart_attack_occurrence is shown from the above figure. There are in total 30,000 roles within the data set representing number of people. From the above figure, we can see the exact number of each column if we move our mouse on to it.\n\nNumber of No Heart Attack occurrence: 27036\nNumber of Heart Attack occurrence: 2964\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nFindings:\n\nImbalance dataset\nsmaller proportion of “yes” group\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEDA 2 would mostly focus on the heart attack occurrence across different age groups. Age could be one of the factors influencing the change of getting heart attack, therefore understanding the trend of heart attack based on age groups is important\n\n\nage_heart_attack &lt;- japan_cleaned %&gt;%\n  filter(Heart_Attack_Occurrence == \"Yes\") %&gt;%  \n  group_by(Age) %&gt;%\n  summarise(Count = n())\n\np &lt;- ggplot(age_heart_attack, aes(x = Age, y = Count)) +\n  geom_line(color = \"#E63946\", size = 1) +  # Red line for actual data\n  geom_point(color = \"#E63946\", size = 2) +  # Red points\n  geom_smooth(method = \"loess\", color = \"#457B9D\", fill = \"#BFD7ED\", se = TRUE, size = 1) +  # Smooth trend line\n  labs(title = \"Interactive Heart Attack Occurrence by Age with Trend\",\n       x = \"Age\",\n       y = \"Number of Heart Attacks\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\ninteractive_Age_plot &lt;- ggplotly(p)\n\ninteractive_Age_plot\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the above graph, the red dot represents different age group’s heart attack number. The blue line represents a smooth trend line to observe the overall pattern.\nHowever, the dots are too many and hard to tell a strong trend therefore we then groups the age by every 10 years. In that case the red dots would be less and hopefully we can see a strong trend.\nTo do so,\n\nStep1: we first need to filter out the person with heart attack.\nStep2: we need to cut the age group by 10 years\nStep3: Count all the number of ‘Yes’ in each group range\nStep4: Plot the line\n\nThe following code would help us achieve those 4 steps:\n\nage_heart_attack_data &lt;- japan_cleaned %&gt;%\n  filter(Heart_Attack_Occurrence == \"Yes\") %&gt;%\n  mutate(Age_Group = cut(Age, breaks = seq(10, 80, by = 10), include.lowest = TRUE)) %&gt;%\n  group_by(Age_Group) %&gt;%\n  summarise(Count = n(), .groups = \"drop\")\n\nage_heart_attack_plot &lt;- ggplot(age_heart_attack_data, aes(x = Age_Group, y = Count, group = 1)) +\n  geom_line(color = \"#E63946\", size = 1) +\n  geom_point(color = \"#E63946\", size = 3) +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"loess\", color = \"#457B9D\", se = FALSE, size = 1) +\n  \n  labs(title = \"Heart Attack Occurrence by Age Group (10-year intervals)\",\n       x = \"Age Group\",\n       y = \"Number of Heart Attacks\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\ninteractive_age_heart_attack &lt;- ggplotly(age_heart_attack_plot)\n\ninteractive_age_heart_attack\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nFindings:\n\nThe trend line from age 10 to age 40 demonstrated a very strong increase indicating that the percentage of getting a heart attack could increase before reaching 40s.\nThe highest number of heart attack appears between age 30 to 40 therefore suggesting that middle aged individuals could have a higher chance of getting heart attacks.\nStaple trend line between age 40 to 80 representing the chance of getting heart attack between old age are still relatively high.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis EDA focus on the number of heart attack occurrence on different range group for cholesterol level. To do this analysis, we first need to see the range for cholesterol level.\n\ncholesterol_violin_plot &lt;- ggplot(japan_cleaned, aes(x = \"\", y = Cholesterol_Level)) +\n  geom_violin(fill = \"#A8DADC\", color = \"black\", alpha = 0.7) +\n  geom_boxplot(width = 0.1, fill = \"white\", color = \"black\", alpha = 0.5) +\n  labs(title = \"Interactive Violin Plot of Cholesterol Levels\",\n       x = \"\",\n       y = \"Cholesterol Level\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\ninteractive_cholesterol_violin &lt;- ggplotly(cholesterol_violin_plot)\n\ninteractive_cholesterol_violin\n\n\n\n\n\nThe above violin plot demonstrates the overall summary for individual’s cholesterol levels. The Max number is 336.86 and the min is 80.02. This indicates that the range is very high. Median is 199.77 with Q1 and Q3 179 and 220. From the information provided we can separate them into 5 groups:\n\n&lt;180 : Low\n180 - 200 : Normal\n200 - 220 : Medium high\n220 - 250 : High\n&gt;= 250 : Very High\n\n\ncholesterol_attack_rate &lt;- japan_cleaned %&gt;%\n  mutate(Cholesterol_Group = cut(Cholesterol_Level, \n                                 breaks = c(0, 180, 200, 220, 250, Inf),  \n                                 labels = c(\"Low\", \"Normal\", \"Medium_High\", \"High\", \"Very High\"),\n                                 include.lowest = TRUE)) %&gt;%\n  group_by(Cholesterol_Group) %&gt;%\n  summarise(Total_Count = n(),\n            Heart_Attack_Count = sum(Heart_Attack_Occurrence == \"Yes\"),\n            Heart_Attack_Rate = (Heart_Attack_Count / Total_Count) * 100,\n            .groups = \"drop\")\n\n\ninteractive_plot &lt;- ggplotly(\n  ggplot(cholesterol_attack_rate, aes(x = Cholesterol_Group, y = Heart_Attack_Rate, group = 1)) +\n    geom_line(color = \"#F00000\", size = 1) +\n    geom_point(color = \"#F00000\", size = 3) +\n    geom_smooth(method = \"loess\", color = \"#0000FF\", se = FALSE, size = 1) +  \n    \n    labs(title = \"Heart Attack Rate Across Cholesterol Groups\",\n         x = \"Cholesterol Group\",\n         y = \"Heart Attack Rate (%)\") +\n    theme_minimal()\n)\n\ninteractive_plot\n\n\n\n\n\nThe above graph has shown the heart attack rate based on different cholesterol groups. The code first calculated the total number of people within each cholesterol groups and afterwards calculated the probability of people getting heart attack within that group. This is done because we want to know the percentage of getting heart attack in each group, however, we can’t make sure each group has the equal amount of individuals. By calculating how many heart attack percent does each group has would be more actuate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nFindings:\n\nNumber of heart attack trends to have a strong relation with cholesterol level based on the interactive plot.\nHighest number of heart attacks has appeared on Very high cholesterol level.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis EDA focuses exploring the relationship between Heart Attack occurrence rate and Stress_Level.\nWe would be using the same steps earlier. First, we would need to group out the stress_level into different groups, therefore, Box plot has been applied.\n\nstress_boxplot &lt;- ggplot(japan_cleaned, aes(x = \"\", y = Stress_Levels)) +\n  geom_boxplot(fill = \"#A8DADC\", color = \"black\", alpha = 0.7) +\n  labs(title = \"Boxplot of Stress Levels\",\n       x = \"\",\n       y = \"Stress Level\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\ninteractive_stress_boxplot &lt;- ggplotly(stress_boxplot)\n\ninteractive_stress_boxplot\n\n\n\n\n\nNext step would be grouping stress level into few groups such as low, moderate, high and very high and see the rate of heart attack occurrence rate. We would be using Heat-map to do check.\n\nstress_attack_rate &lt;- japan_cleaned %&gt;%\n  mutate(Stress_Group = cut(Stress_Levels, \n                            breaks = c(0, 3.5, 5.5, 7.5, 10),  \n                            labels = c(\"Low\", \"Moderate\", \"High\", \"Very High\"),\n                            include.lowest = TRUE)) %&gt;%\n  group_by(Stress_Group) %&gt;%\n  summarise(Total_Count = n(),  \n            Heart_Attack_Count = sum(Heart_Attack_Occurrence == \"Yes\"),  \n            Heart_Attack_Rate = (Heart_Attack_Count / Total_Count) * 100,  \n            .groups = \"drop\")\n\nstress_attack_heatmap &lt;- ggplot(stress_attack_rate, aes(x = Stress_Group, y = \"\", fill = Heart_Attack_Rate)) +\n  geom_tile() +\n  scale_fill_gradient(low = \"#FFD7D7\", high = \"#F00000\") +\n  labs(title = \"Heatmap of Heart Attack Rate by Stress Level\",\n       x = \"Stress Level\",\n       y = \"\",\n       fill = \"Heart Attack Rate (%)\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n \ninteractive_stress_attack_heatmap &lt;- ggplotly(stress_attack_heatmap)\n\ninteractive_stress_attack_heatmap\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nFindings:\nThis heatmap illustrates the heart attack rate across different stress levels. Darker colors indicate a higher heart attack rate, while lighter colors represent a lower rate.\nThe chart shows that individuals in the Low stress group have the highest heart attack rate, while the rate gradually decreases as stress levels increase. This suggests that, in this dataset, people with lower stress levels may actually have a higher incidence of heart attacks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nheart_rate_histogram &lt;- ggplot(japan_cleaned, aes(x = Heart_Rate)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins = 30, fill = \"#FF9200\", color = \"black\", alpha = 0.8) +\n  labs(title = \"Histogram of Heart Rate\",\n       x = \"Heart Rate\",\n       y = \"Count\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\ninteractive_Heart_rate_plot &lt;-ggplotly(heart_rate_histogram)\ninteractive_Heart_rate_plot\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(japan_cleaned, aes(x = Heart_Rate, fill = Heart_Attack_Occurrence, color = Heart_Attack_Occurrence)) +\n  geom_density(alpha = 0.4, size = 1) +  \n  labs(title = \"Density Distribution of Heart Rate by Heart Attack Occurrence\",\n       x = \"Heart Rate\",\n       y = \"Density\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"No\" = \"#457B9D\", \"Yes\" = \"#E63946\")) + \n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"No\" = \"#1D3557\", \"Yes\" = \"#D62828\")) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nFindings:\nThis heart rate density distribution plot compares individuals who experienced a heart attack versus those who did not based on their heart rate distribution. Both groups exhibit a unimodal distribution, with most heart rates concentrated between 60 and 80.\nIn the lower heart rate range (50-60), the No group is significantly larger than the Yes group, suggesting that heart attack occurrence is lower among individuals with lower heart rates.\nConversely, in the higher heart rate range (above 80), the Yes group becomes more prevalent, indicating that higher heart rates may be associated with an increased risk of heart attacks.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter exploring some of the factor’s relation with heart attack occurrence, it is time for us to check what are some possible factors that can be analyzed in the future. By applying logistic regression model, we can determine their statistical significant level.\n\neda6 &lt;- japan_cleaned %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    Heart_Attack_Occurrence = ifelse(Heart_Attack_Occurrence == \"No\", 0, 1),\n    Alcohol_Consumption = ifelse(Alcohol_Consumption == \"None\", 0, 1),\n    Diet_Quality = ifelse(Diet_Quality == \"Poor\", 0, 1),\n    Physical_Activity = ifelse(Physical_Activity == \"Low\", 0, 1),\n    Smoking_History = ifelse(Smoking_History == \"No\", 0, 1),\n    Hypertension_History = ifelse(Hypertension_History == \"No\", 0, 1),\n    Diabetes_History = ifelse(Diabetes_History == \"No\", 0, 1),\n    Family_History = ifelse(Family_History == \"No\", 0, 1)\n  ) %&gt;%\n  select(-Gender)\n\nlogit_model &lt;- glm(Heart_Attack_Occurrence ~ . - Age - Cholesterol_Level - Stress_Levels - Heart_Rate - Alcohol_Consumption, \n                   data = eda6, \n                   family = binomial)\n\nggcoefstats(logit_model, palette = \"Dark2\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis plot above presents the results of a logistic regression model, analyzing various health factors and their influence on heart attack occurrence. The X-axis represents the estimated coefficients, indicating the direction and magnitude of each variable’s effect on heart attack risk, while the p-values inside the bubbles reflect their statistical significance.\nFrom the regression results, basically there are none of the variable’s p-value is below 0.05. This indicating that these factors is statistically insignificant on heart attack occurrence.\nHowever, this does not imply that these factors are irrelevant in medical research. The lack of significance in this model may be caused by the limited small propotion of the sample size, data quality, or the influence of interactions between variables.\n\n\n\n\nThis analysis explored various factors influencing heart attack occurrence using data visualization and logistic regression. While some trends were observed, most factors did not show strong statistical significance in predicting heart attacks. Further research with a larger dataset, interaction effects, and additional health indicators may improve the model’s predictive power and provide deeper insights into heart attack risk factors.\nFactors that might increase the chance of getting heart attack:\n\nAge: The highest heart attack occurrence is observed between ages 30-40, with a consistently high rate from 40-80, suggesting that middle-aged and older individuals are at higher risk.\n\n\n\nCholesterol Level: The heart attack rate increases with higher cholesterol levels, with the “Very High” group showing the highest risk, indicating that high cholesterol is a significant risk factor.\nStress Levels: Interestingly, individuals with low stress levels have the highest heart attack rate, though this trend may be influenced by other health factors, requiring further investigation.\nHeart Rate: The “Yes” group is more prevalent in the higher heart rate range (above 80), suggesting a potential association between high heart rate and heart attack risk.\n\n\n\n\nIncreasing the sample size to improve statistical power and identify potential influencing factors.\nIncrease other factors that might cause heart attack.\n\nThis projects has some very interesting findings however, using these variables alone may not be sufficient for accurately predicting heart attack occurrence. More samples and analysis needs to be conducted before understanding what truely affects heart attack occurrence. Even though it is not 100% correct but they could still play an important role in more complex multi-factor predictive models in future research."

Both groups exhibit a unimodal distribution, with most heart rates concentrated between 60 and 80.\nIn the lower heart rate range (50-60), the No group is significantly larger than the Yes group, suggesting that heart attack occurrence is lower among individuals with lower heart rates.\nConversely, in the higher heart rate range (above 80), the Yes group becomes more prevalent, indicating that higher heart rates may be associated with an increased risk of heart attacks.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter exploring some of the factor’s relation with heart attack occurrence, it is time for us to check what are some possible factors that can be analyzed in the future. By applying logistic regression model, we can determine their statistical significant level.\n\neda6 &lt;- japan_cleaned %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    Heart_Attack_Occurrence = ifelse(Heart_Attack_Occurrence == \"No\", 0, 1),\n    Alcohol_Consumption = ifelse(Alcohol_Consumption == \"None\", 0, 1),\n    Diet_Quality = ifelse(Diet_Quality == \"Poor\", 0, 1),\n    Physical_Activity = ifelse(Physical_Activity == \"Low\", 0, 1),\n    Smoking_History = ifelse(Smoking_History == \"No\", 0, 1),\n    Hypertension_History = ifelse(Hypertension_History == \"No\", 0, 1),\n    Diabetes_History = ifelse(Diabetes_History == \"No\", 0, 1),\n    Family_History = ifelse(Family_History == \"No\", 0, 1)\n  ) %&gt;%\n  select(-Gender)\n\nlogit_model &lt;- glm(Heart_Attack_Occurrence ~ . - Age - Cholesterol_Level - Stress_Levels - Heart_Rate - Alcohol_Consumption, \n                   data = eda6, \n                   family = binomial)\n\nggcoefstats(logit_model, palette = \"Dark2\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis plot above presents the results of a logistic regression model, analyzing various health factors and their influence on heart attack occurrence. The X-axis represents the estimated coefficients, indicating the direction and magnitude of each variable’s effect on heart attack risk, while the p-values inside the bubbles reflect their statistical significance.\nFrom the regression results, basically there are none of the variable’s p-value is below 0.05. This indicating that these factors is statistically insignificant on heart attack occurrence.\nHowever, this does not imply that these factors are irrelevant in medical research. The lack of significance in this model may be caused by the limited small propotion of the sample size, data quality, or the influence of interactions between variables."

    "text": "This analysis explored various factors influencing heart attack occurrence using data visualization and logistic regression. While some trends were observed, most factors did not show strong statistical significance in predicting heart attacks. Further research with a larger dataset, interaction effects, and additional health indicators may improve the model’s predictive power and provide deeper insights into heart attack risk factors.\nFactors that might increase the chance of getting heart attack:\n\nAge: The highest heart attack occurrence is observed between ages 30-40, with a consistently high rate from 40-80, suggesting that middle-aged and older individuals are at higher risk.\n\n\n\nCholesterol Level: The heart attack rate increases with higher cholesterol levels, with the “Very High” group showing the highest risk, indicating that high cholesterol is a significant risk factor.\nStress Levels: Interestingly, individuals with low stress levels have the highest heart attack rate, though this trend may be influenced by other health factors, requiring further investigation.\nHeart Rate: The “Yes” group is more prevalent in the higher heart rate range (above 80), suggesting a potential association between high heart rate and heart attack risk.\n\n\n\n\nIncreasing the sample size to improve statistical power and identify potential influencing factors.\nIncrease other factors that might cause heart attack.\n\nThis projects has some very interesting findings however, using these variables alone may not be sufficient for accurately predicting heart attack occurrence. More samples and analysis needs to be conducted before understanding what truely affects heart attack occurrence. Even though it is not 100% correct but they could still play an important role in more complex multi-factor predictive models in future research."

    "text": "17.4 Plotting Calendar Heatmap\nIn this section, I learn how to plot a calender heatmap programmatically by using ggplot2 package.\n\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\nplot a calender heatmap by using ggplot2 functions and extension,\nto write function using R programming,\nto derive specific date and time related field by using base R and lubridate packages\nto perform data preparation task by using tidyr and dplyr packages.\n\n\n17.4.1 The Data\nFor the purpose of this hands-on exercise, eventlog.csv file will be used. This data file consists of 199,999 rows of time-series cyber attack records by country.\n\n\n17.4.2 Importing the data\nFirst, I use the code chunk below to import eventlog.csv file into R environment and called the data frame as attacks.\n\nattacks &lt;- read_csv(\"data/eventlog.csv\",show_col_types = FALSE)\n\n\n\n17.4.3 Examining the data structure\nIt is always a good practice to examine the imported data frame before further analysis is performed.\nFor example, kable() can be used to review the structure of the imported data frame.\n\nkable(head(attacks))\n\n\n\n\ntimestamp\nsource_country\ntz\n\n\n\n\n2015-03-12 15:59:16\nCN\nAsia/Shanghai\n\n\n2015-03-12 16:00:48\nFR\nEurope/Paris\n\n\n2015-03-12 16:02:26\nCN\nAsia/Shanghai\n\n\n2015-03-12 16:02:38\nUS\nAmerica/Chicago\n\n\n2015-03-12 16:03:22\nCN\nAsia/Shanghai\n\n\n2015-03-12 16:03:45\nCN\nAsia/Shanghai\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are three columns, namely timestamp, source_country and tz.\n\ntimestamp field stores date-time values in POSIXct format.\nsource_country field stores the source of the attack. It is in ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code.\ntz field stores time zone of the source IP address.\n\n\n\n17.4.4 Data Preparation\nStep 1: Deriving weekday and hour of day fields\nBefore we can plot the calender heatmap, two new fields namely wkday and hour need to be derived. In this step, we will write a function to perform the task.\n\nmake_hr_wkday &lt;- function(ts, sc, tz) {\n  real_times &lt;- ymd_hms(ts, \n                        tz = tz[1], \n                        quiet = TRUE)\n  dt &lt;- data.table(source_country = sc,\n                   wkday = weekdays(real_times),\n                   hour = hour(real_times))\n  return(dt)\n  }\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nymd_hms() and hour() are from lubridate package, and\nweekdays() is a base R function.\n\n\n\nStep 2: Deriving the attacks tibble data frame\n\nwkday_levels &lt;- c('Saturday', 'Friday', \n                  'Thursday', 'Wednesday', \n                  'Tuesday', 'Monday', \n                  'Sunday')\n\nattacks &lt;- attacks %&gt;%\n  group_by(tz) %&gt;%\n  do(make_hr_wkday(.$timestamp, \n                   .$source_country, \n                   .$tz)) %&gt;% \n  ungroup() %&gt;% \n  mutate(wkday = factor(\n    wkday, levels = wkday_levels),\n    hour  = factor(\n      hour, levels = 0:23))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nBeside extracting the necessary data into attacks data frame, mutate() of dplyr package is used to convert wkday and hour fields into factor so they’ll be ordered when plotting\n\n\nTable below shows the tidy tibble table after processing.\n\nkable(head(attacks))\n\n\n\n\ntz\nsource_country\nwkday\nhour\n\n\n\n\nAfrica/Cairo\nBG\nSaturday\n20\n\n\nAfrica/Cairo\nTW\nSunday\n6\n\n\nAfrica/Cairo\nTW\nSunday\n8\n\n\nAfrica/Cairo\nCN\nSunday\n11\n\n\nAfrica/Cairo\nUS\nSunday\n15\n\n\nAfrica/Cairo\nCA\nMonday\n11\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n17.4.5 Building the Calendar Heatmaps\n\ngrouped &lt;- attacks %&gt;% \n  count(wkday, hour) %&gt;% \n  ungroup() %&gt;%\n  na.omit()\n\nggplot(grouped, \n       aes(hour, \n           wkday, \n           fill = n)) + \ngeom_tile(color = \"white\", \n          size = 0.1) + \ntheme_tufte(base_family = \"Helvetica\") + \ncoord_equal() +\nscale_fill_gradient(name = \"# of attacks\",\n                    low = \"sky blue\", \n                    high = \"dark blue\") +\nlabs(x = NULL, \n     y = NULL, \n     title = \"Attacks by weekday and time of day\") +\ntheme(axis.ticks = element_blank(),\n      plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),\n      legend.title = element_text(size = 8),\n      legend.text = element_text(size = 6) )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\na tibble data table called grouped is derived by aggregating the attack by wkday and hour fields.\na new field called n is derived by using group_by() and count() functions.\nna.omit() is used to exclude missing value.\ngeom_tile() is used to plot tiles (grids) at each x and y position. color and size arguments are used to specify the border color and line size of the tiles.\ntheme_tufte() of ggthemes package is used to remove unnecessary chart junk. To learn which visual components of default ggplot2 have been excluded, you are encouraged to comment out this line to examine the default plot.\ncoord_equal() is used to ensure the plot will have an aspect ratio of 1:1.\nscale_fill_gradient() function is used to creates a two colour gradient (low-high).\n\n\n\nThen we can simply group the count by hour and wkday and plot it, since we know that we have values for every combination there’s no need to further preprocess the data.\n\n\n17.4.6 Building Multiple Calendar Heatmaps\nChallenge: Building multiple heatmaps for the top four countries with the highest number of attacks.\n\n\n\n17.4.7 Plotting Multiple Calendar Heatmaps\nStep 1: Deriving attack by country object\nIn order to identify the top 4 countries with the highest number of attacks, you are required to do the followings:\n\ncount the number of attacks by country,\ncalculate the percent of attackes by country, and\nsave the results in a tibble data frame.\n\n\nattacks_by_country &lt;- count(\n  attacks, source_country) %&gt;%\n  mutate(percent = percent(n/sum(n))) %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(n))\n\nStep 2: Preparing the tidy data frame\nIn this step, you are required to extract the attack records of the top 4 countries from attacks data frame and save the data in a new tibble data frame (i.e. top4_attacks).\n\ntop4 &lt;- attacks_by_country$source_country[1:4]\ntop4_attacks &lt;- attacks %&gt;%\n  filter(source_country %in% top4) %&gt;%\n  count(source_country, wkday, hour) %&gt;%\n  ungroup() %&gt;%\n  mutate(source_country = factor(\n    source_country, levels = top4)) %&gt;%\n  na.omit()\n\n\n\n17.4.8 Plotting Multiple Calendar Heatmaps\nStep 3: Plotting the Multiple Calender Heatmap by using ggplot2 package.\n\nggplot(top4_attacks, \n       aes(hour, \n           wkday, \n           fill = n)) + \n  geom_tile(color = \"white\", \n          size = 0.1) + \n  theme_tufte(base_family = \"Helvetica\") + \n  coord_equal() +\n  scale_fill_gradient(name = \"# of attacks\",\n                    low = \"sky blue\", \n                    high = \"dark blue\") +\n  facet_wrap(~source_country, ncol = 2) +\n  labs(x = NULL, y = NULL, \n     title = \"Attacks on top 4 countries by weekday and time of day\") +\n  theme(axis.ticks = element_blank(),\n        axis.text.x = element_text(size = 7),\n        plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),\n        legend.title = element_text(size = 8),\n        legend.text = element_text(size = 6) )"

The data set is download at https://s3.amazonaws.com/happiness-report/2018/WHR2018Chapter2OnlineData.xls. The original data set is in Microsoft Excel format. It has been extracted and saved in csv file called WHData-2018.csv.\nIn the code chunk below, read_csv() of readr package is used to import WHData-2018.csv into R and save it into a tibble data frame object called wh.\n\nwh &lt;- read_csv(\"data/WHData-2018.csv\",show_col_types = FALSE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this section, you will learn how to plot static parallel coordinates plot by using ggparcoord() of GGally package. Before getting started, it is a good practice to read the function description in detail.\n\n\nCode chunk below shows a typical syntax used to plot a basic static parallel coordinates plot by using ggparcoord().\n\nggparcoord(data = wh, \n           columns = c(7:12))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that only two argument namely data and columns is used. Data argument is used to map the data object (i.e. wh) and columns is used to select the columns for preparing the parallel coordinates plot.\n\n\n\nThe basic parallel coordinates failed to reveal any meaning understanding of the World Happiness measures. In this section, you will learn how to makeover the plot by using a collection of arguments provided by ggparcoord().\n\nggparcoord(data = wh, \n           columns = c(7:12), \n           groupColumn = 2,\n           scale = \"uniminmax\",\n           alphaLines = 0.2,\n           boxplot = TRUE, \n           title = \"Parallel Coordinates Plot of World Happines Variables\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThings to learn from the code chunk above.\n\ngroupColumn argument is used to group the observations (i.e. parallel lines) by using a single variable (i.e. Region) and colour the parallel coordinates lines by region name.\nscale argument is used to scale the variables in the parallel coordinate plot by using uniminmax method. The method univariately scale each variable so the minimum of the variable is zero and the maximum is one.\nalphaLines argument is used to reduce the intensity of the line colour to 0.2. The permissible value range is between 0 to 1.\nboxplot argument is used to turn on the boxplot by using logical TRUE. The default is FALSE.\ntitle argument is used to provide the parallel coordinates plot a title.\n\n\n\n\nSince ggparcoord() is developed by extending ggplot2 package, we can combination use some of the ggplot2 function when plotting a parallel coordinates plot.\nIn the code chunk below, facet_wrap() of ggplot2 is used to plot 10 small multiple parallel coordinates plots. Each plot represent one geographical region such as East Asia.\n\nggparcoord(data = wh, \n           columns = c(7:12), \n           groupColumn = 2,\n           scale = \"uniminmax\",\n           alphaLines = 0.2,\n           boxplot = TRUE, \n           title = \"Multiple Parallel Coordinates Plots of World Happines Variables by Region\") +\n  facet_wrap(~ Region)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the aesthetic defect of the current design is that some of the variable names overlap on x-axis.\n\n\n\nTo make the x-axis text label easy to read, let us rotate the labels by 30 degrees. We can rotate axis text labels using theme() function in ggplot2 as shown in the code chunk below\n\nggparcoord(data = wh, \n           columns = c(7:12), \n           groupColumn = 2,\n           scale = \"uniminmax\",\n           alphaLines = 0.2,\n           boxplot = TRUE, \n           title = \"Multiple Parallel Coordinates Plots of World Happines Variables by Region\") +\n  facet_wrap(~ Region) + \n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 30))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThing to learn from the code chunk above:\n\nTo rotate x-axis text labels, we use axis.text.x as argument to theme() function. And we specify element_text(angle = 30) to rotate the x-axis text by an angle 30 degree.\n\n\n\n\nRotating x-axis text labels to 30 degrees makes the label overlap with the plot and we can avoid this by adjusting the text location using hjust argument to theme’s text element with element_text(). We use axis.text.x as we want to change the look of x-axis text.\n\nggparcoord(data = wh, \n           columns = c(7:12), \n           groupColumn = 2,\n           scale = \"uniminmax\",\n           alphaLines = 0.2,\n           boxplot = TRUE, \n           title = \"Multiple Parallel Coordinates Plots of World Happines Variables by Region\") +\n  facet_wrap(~ Region) + \n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 30, hjust=1))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nparallelPlot is an R package specially designed to plot a parallel coordinates plot by using ‘htmlwidgets’ package and d3.js. In this section, you will learn how to use functions provided in parallelPlot package to build interactive parallel coordinates plot.\n\n\nThe code chunk below plot an interactive parallel coordinates plot by using parallelPlot().\n\nwh &lt;- wh %&gt;%\n  select(\"Happiness score\", c(7:12))\nparallelPlot(wh,\n             width = 320,\n             height = 250)\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that some of the axis labels are too long. You will learn how to overcome this problem in the next step.\n\n\n\nIn the code chunk below, rotateTitle argument is used to avoid overlapping axis labels.\n\nparallelPlot(wh,\n             rotateTitle = TRUE)\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the useful interactive feature of parallelPlot is we can click on a variable of interest, for example Happiness score, the monotonous blue colour (default) will change a blues with different intensity colour scheme will be used.\n\n\n\nWe can change the default blue colour scheme by using continousCS argument as shown in the code chunl below.\n\nparallelPlot(wh,\n             continuousCS = \"YlOrRd\",\n             rotateTitle = TRUE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the code chunk below, histoVisibility argument is used to plot histogram along the axis of each variables.\n\nhistoVisibility &lt;- rep(TRUE, ncol(wh))\nparallelPlot(wh,\n             rotateTitle = TRUE,\n             histoVisibility = histoVisibility)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggparcoord() of GGally package\nparcoords user guide\nparallelPlot"

    "text": "In this section, you will learn how to plot static parallel coordinates plot by using ggparcoord() of GGally package. Before getting started, it is a good practice to read the function description in detail.\n\n\nCode chunk below shows a typical syntax used to plot a basic static parallel coordinates plot by using ggparcoord().\n\nggparcoord(data = wh, \n           columns = c(7:12))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that only two argument namely data and columns is used. Data argument is used to map the data object (i.e. wh) and columns is used to select the columns for preparing the parallel coordinates plot.\n\n\n\nThe basic parallel coordinates failed to reveal any meaning understanding of the World Happiness measures. In this section, you will learn how to makeover the plot by using a collection of arguments provided by ggparcoord().\n\nggparcoord(data = wh, \n           columns = c(7:12), \n           groupColumn = 2,\n           scale = \"uniminmax\",\n           alphaLines = 0.2,\n           boxplot = TRUE, \n           title = \"Parallel Coordinates Plot of World Happines Variables\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThings to learn from the code chunk above.\n\ngroupColumn argument is used to group the observations (i.e. parallel lines) by using a single variable (i.e. Region) and colour the parallel coordinates lines by region name.\nscale argument is used to scale the variables in the parallel coordinate plot by using uniminmax method. The method univariately scale each variable so the minimum of the variable is zero and the maximum is one.\nalphaLines argument is used to reduce the intensity of the line colour to 0.2. The permissible value range is between 0 to 1.\nboxplot argument is used to turn on the boxplot by using logical TRUE. The default is FALSE.\ntitle argument is used to provide the parallel coordinates plot a title.\n\n\n\n\nSince ggparcoord() is developed by extending ggplot2 package, we can combination use some of the ggplot2 function when plotting a parallel coordinates plot.\nIn the code chunk below, facet_wrap() of ggplot2 is used to plot 10 small multiple parallel coordinates plots. Each plot represent one geographical region such as East Asia.\n\nggparcoord(data = wh, \n           columns = c(7:12), \n           groupColumn = 2,\n           scale = \"uniminmax\",\n           alphaLines = 0.2,\n           boxplot = TRUE, \n           title = \"Multiple Parallel Coordinates Plots of World Happines Variables by Region\") +\n  facet_wrap(~ Region)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the aesthetic defect of the current design is that some of the variable names overlap on x-axis.\n\n\n\nTo make the x-axis text label easy to read, let us rotate the labels by 30 degrees. We can rotate axis text labels using theme() function in ggplot2 as shown in the code chunk below\n\nggparcoord(data = wh, \n           columns = c(7:12), \n           groupColumn = 2,\n           scale = \"uniminmax\",\n           alphaLines = 0.2,\n           boxplot = TRUE, \n           title = \"Multiple Parallel Coordinates Plots of World Happines Variables by Region\") +\n  facet_wrap(~ Region) + \n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 30))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThing to learn from the code chunk above:\n\nTo rotate x-axis text labels, we use axis.text.x as argument to theme() function. And we specify element_text(angle = 30) to rotate the x-axis text by an angle 30 degree.\n\n\n\n\nRotating x-axis text labels to 30 degrees makes the label overlap with the plot and we can avoid this by adjusting the text location using hjust argument to theme’s text element with element_text(). We use axis.text.x as we want to change the look of x-axis text.\n\nggparcoord(data = wh, \n           columns = c(7:12), \n           groupColumn = 2,\n           scale = \"uniminmax\",\n           alphaLines = 0.2,\n           boxplot = TRUE, \n           title = \"Multiple Parallel Coordinates Plots of World Happines Variables by Region\") +\n  facet_wrap(~ Region) + \n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 30, hjust=1))"

    "text": "The correlation coefficient measures the type and strength of the relationship between two variables, ranging from -1.0 (perfect inverse relationship) to 1.0 (perfect positive relationship), with 0 indicating no linear relationship. When working with multivariate data, correlation coefficients are displayed in a correlation matrix or scatterplot matrix.\nCorrelation matrices are useful for revealing relationships between variables, serving as inputs for analyses like factor analysis and regression, and diagnosing issues like multicollinearity in regression models. For large datasets, corrgrams are used to visually explore relationships by rendering correlation values and reordering variables for better interpretation.\nThis exercise covers three key methods for visualizing correlation matrices in R:\n\nUsing pairs() from R Graphics to create a basic correlation matrix.\nUsing the corrplot package to generate a corrgram.\nUsing plotly to create an interactive correlation matrix for deeper exploration.\n\n\n\n\n\nInstalling and Launching R PackagesImporting and Preparing the Data Set\n\n\n\npacman::p_load(corrplot, ggstatsplot, tidyverse)\n\n\n\nIn this hands-on exercise, the Wine Quality Data Set of UCI Machine Learning Repository will be used. The data set consists of 13 variables and 6497 observations. For the purpose of this exercise, we have combined the red wine and white wine data into one data file. It is called wine_quality and is in csv file format.\n\nwine &lt;- read_csv(\"data/wine_quality.csv\",show_col_types = FALSE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are more than one way to build scatterplot matrix with R. In this section, you will learn how to create a scatterplot matrix by using the pairs function of R Graphics.\nBefore you continue to the next step, you should read the syntax description of pairsfunction.\n\n\nFigure below shows the scatter plot matrix of Wine Quality Data. It is a 11 by 11 matrix.\n\npairs(wine[,1:11])\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe required input of pairs() can be a matrix or data frame. The code chunk used to create the scatterplot matrix is relatively simple. It uses the default pairs function. Columns 2 to 12 of wine dataframe is used to build the scatterplot matrix. The variables are: fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, chlorides, free sulfur dioxide, total sulfur dioxide, density, pH, sulphates and alcohol.\n\npairs(wine[,2:12])\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npairs(wine[,2:12], upper.panel = NULL)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below displays the upper half of the correlation matrix.\n\npairs(wine[,2:12], lower.panel = NULL)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo show the correlation coefficient of each pair of variables instead of a scatter plot, panel.cor function will be used. This will also show higher correlations in a larger font.\n\npanel.cor &lt;- function(x, y, digits=2, prefix=\"\", cex.cor, ...) {\nusr &lt;- par(\"usr\")\non.exit(par(usr))\npar(usr = c(0, 1, 0, 1))\nr &lt;- abs(cor(x, y, use=\"complete.obs\"))\ntxt &lt;- format(c(r, 0.123456789), digits=digits)[1]\ntxt &lt;- paste(prefix, txt, sep=\"\")\nif(missing(cex.cor)) cex.cor &lt;- 0.8/strwidth(txt)\ntext(0.5, 0.5, txt, cex = cex.cor * (1 + r) / 2)\n}\n\npairs(wine[,2:12], \n      upper.panel = panel.cor)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA major limitation of the correlation matrix is that scatter plots become cluttered when dealing with large datasets (over 500 observations). To address this, the Corrgram visualization technique, proposed by D. J. Murdoch & E. D. Chow (1996) and M. Friendly (2002), provides a clearer representation of relationships between variables.\nSeveral R packages can be used to create corrgrams, including corrgram, ellipse, and corrplot. Additionally, the ggstatsplot package offers functions for building corrgrams.\nIn this section, I will learn how to visualize a correlation matrix using ggcorrmat() from the ggstatsplot package, which provides an enhanced and structured approach to displaying correlation relationships.\n\n\nOn of the advantage of using ggcorrmat() over many other methods to visualise a correlation matrix is it’s ability to provide a comprehensive and yet professional statistical report as shown in the figure below.\n\nggstatsplot::ggcorrmat(\n  data = wine, \n  cor.vars = 1:11)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggstatsplot::ggcorrmat(\n  data = wine, \n  cor.vars = 1:11,\n  ggcorrplot.args = list(outline.color = \"black\", \n                         hc.order = TRUE,\n                         tl.cex = 10),\n  title    = \"Correlogram for wine dataset\",\n  subtitle = \"Four pairs are no significant at p &lt; 0.05\"\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThings to learn from the code chunk above:\n\ncor.vars argument is used to compute the correlation matrix needed to build the corrgram.\nggcorrplot.args argument provide additional (mostly aesthetic) arguments that will be passed to ggcorrplot::ggcorrplot function. The list should avoid any of the following arguments since they are already internally being used: corr, method, p.mat, sig.level, ggtheme, colors, lab, pch, legend.title, digits.\n\n\n\nThe sample sub-code chunk can be used to control specific component of the plot such as the font size of the x-axis, y-axis, and the statistical report.\n\nggplot.component = list(\n    theme(text=element_text(size=5),\n      axis.text.x = element_text(size = 8),\n      axis.text.y = element_text(size = 8)))\n\n\n\n\nSince ggstasplot is an extension of ggplot2, it also supports faceting. However the feature is not available in ggcorrmat() but in the grouped_ggcorrmat() of ggstatsplot.\n\ngrouped_ggcorrmat(\n  data = wine,\n  cor.vars = 1:11,\n  grouping.var = type,\n  type = \"robust\",\n  p.adjust.method = \"holm\",\n  plotgrid.args = list(ncol = 2),\n  ggcorrplot.args = list(outline.color = \"black\", \n                         hc.order = TRUE,\n                         tl.cex = 10),\n  annotation.args = list(\n    tag_levels = \"a\",\n    title = \"Correlogram for wine dataset\",\n    subtitle = \"The measures are: alcohol, sulphates, fixed acidity, citric acid, chlorides, residual sugar, density, free sulfur dioxide and volatile acidity\",\n    caption = \"Dataset: UCI Machine Learning Repository\"\n  )\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThings to learn from the code chunk above:\n\nto build a facet plot, the only argument needed is grouping.var.\nBehind group_ggcorrmat(), patchwork package is used to create the multiplot. plotgrid.args argument provides a list of additional arguments passed to patchwork::wrap_plots, except for guides argument which is already separately specified earlier.\nLikewise, annotation.args argument is calling plot annotation arguments of patchwork package.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore we can plot a corrgram using corrplot(), we need to compute the correlation matrix of wine data frame.\nIn the code chunk below, cor() of R Stats is used to compute the correlation matrix of wine data frame.\n\n\nwine.cor &lt;- cor(wine[, 1:11])\n\nNext, corrplot() is used to plot the corrgram by using all the default setting as shown in the code chunk below.\n\ncorrplot(wine.cor)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nThe default visual representation for a corrgram is a circle, displayed in a symmetric matrix layout.\nThe blue-red diverging color scheme represents correlation coefficients, with blue for positive correlations and red for negative correlations.\nThe saturation (intensity) of the color indicates the strength of the correlation, with darker colors representing stronger relationships.\nDarker colors indicate stronger linear correlations, while lighter colors suggest weaker relationships.\nThis visualization helps identify patterns and relationships between multiple variables efficiently.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncorrplot(wine.cor, \n         method = \"ellipse\") \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nThe corrplot package supports seven visual geometries: circle, square, ellipse, number, shade, color, and pie.\nThe default visual representation is a circle, but it can be changed using the method argument.\nThe example uses method = \"ellipse\", which displays correlations as ellipses.\nDifferent geometries help in better understanding correlation patterns based on user preference.\nUsers can experiment with various method options to customize the visualization.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncorrplot(wine.cor, \n         method = \"ellipse\", \n         type=\"lower\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe default layout of the corrgram can be further customised. For example, arguments diag and tl.col are used to turn off the diagonal cells and to change the axis text label colour to black colour respectively as shown in the code chunk and figure below.\n\ncorrplot(wine.cor, \n         method = \"ellipse\", \n         type=\"lower\",\n         diag = FALSE,\n         tl.col = \"black\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith corrplot package, it is possible to design corrgram with mixed visual matrix of one half and numerical matrix on the other half. In order to create a coorgram with mixed layout, the corrplot.mixed(), a wrapped function for mixed visualisation style will be used.\nFigure below shows a mixed layout corrgram plotted using wine quality data.\n\ncorrplot.mixed(wine.cor, \n               lower = \"ellipse\", \n               upper = \"number\",\n               tl.pos = \"lt\",\n               diag = \"l\",\n               tl.col = \"black\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncorrplot.mixed(wine.cor, \n               lower = \"ellipse\", \n               upper = \"number\",\n               tl.pos = \"lt\",\n               diag = \"l\",\n               tl.col = \"black\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nThe lower and upper arguments define the visualization methods for the lower and upper halves of the corrgram.\nIn this example, ellipses are used for the lower half, while numerical values represent correlations in the upper half.\nThe tl.pos argument controls the placement of axis labels.\nThe diag argument specifies the glyph type used on the principal diagonal.\nThis mixed visualization provides both graphical and numerical insights into correlation relationships.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn statistical analysis, it is important to determine which variable pairs have statistically significant correlations. The corrgram shown includes a significance test, revealing that not all correlations are statistically meaningful. For example, the correlation between total sulfur dioxide and free sulfur dioxide is significant at a 0.1 level, while the correlation between total sulfur dioxide and citric acid is not. The black “X” marks indicate non-significant correlations, helping to differentiate meaningful relationships from random associations.\n\nwine.sig = cor.mtest(wine.cor, conf.level= .95)\n\nThen use the p.mat shown below\n\npar(bg = \"#f5f5f5\")\n\ncorrplot(wine.cor,\n         method = \"number\",\n         type = \"lower\",\n         diag = FALSE,\n         tl.col = \"black\",\n         tl.srt = 45,\n         p.mat = wine.sig$p,\n         sig.level = .05,\n         tl.cex = 0.6,\n         bg=\"#f5f5f5\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMatrix reorder is very important for mining the hiden structure and pattern in a corrgram. By default, the order of attributes of a corrgram is sorted according to the correlation matrix (i.e. “original”). The default setting can be over-write by using the order argument of corrplot(). Currently, corrplot package support four sorting methods, they are:\n\n“AOE” is for the angular order of the eigenvectors. See Michael Friendly (2002) for details.\n“FPC” for the first principal component order.\n“hclust” for hierarchical clustering order, and “hclust.method” for the agglomeration method to be used.\n\n“hclust.method” should be one of “ward”, “single”, “complete”, “average”, “mcquitty”, “median” or “centroid”.\n\n“alphabet” for alphabetical order.\n\n“AOE”, “FPC”, “hclust”, “alphabet”. More algorithms can be found in seriation package.\n\ncorrplot.mixed(wine.cor, \n               lower = \"ellipse\", \n               upper = \"number\",\n               tl.pos = \"lt\",\n               diag = \"l\",\n               order=\"AOE\",\n               tl.col = \"black\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncorrplot(wine.cor, \n         method = \"ellipse\", \n         tl.pos = \"lt\",\n         tl.col = \"black\",\n         order=\"hclust\",\n         hclust.method = \"ward.D\",\n         addrect = 3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMichael Friendly (2002). “Corrgrams: Exploratory displays for correlation matrices”.

Additionally, the ggstatsplot package offers functions for building corrgrams.\nIn this section, I will learn how to visualize a correlation matrix using ggcorrmat() from the ggstatsplot package, which provides an enhanced and structured approach to displaying correlation relationships.\n\n\nOn of the advantage of using ggcorrmat() over many other methods to visualise a correlation matrix is it’s ability to provide a comprehensive and yet professional statistical report as shown in the figure below.\n\nggstatsplot::ggcorrmat(\n  data = wine, \n  cor.vars = 1:11)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggstatsplot::ggcorrmat(\n  data = wine, \n  cor.vars = 1:11,\n  ggcorrplot.args = list(outline.color = \"black\", \n                         hc.order = TRUE,\n                         tl.cex = 10),\n  title    = \"Correlogram for wine dataset\",\n  subtitle = \"Four pairs are no significant at p &lt; 0.05\"\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThings to learn from the code chunk above:\n\ncor.vars argument is used to compute the correlation matrix needed to build the corrgram.\nggcorrplot.args argument provide additional (mostly aesthetic) arguments that will be passed to ggcorrplot::ggcorrplot function. The list should avoid any of the following arguments since they are already internally being used: corr, method, p.mat, sig.level, ggtheme, colors, lab, pch, legend.title, digits.\n\n\n\nThe sample sub-code chunk can be used to control specific component of the plot such as the font size of the x-axis, y-axis, and the statistical report.\n\nggplot.component = list(\n    theme(text=element_text(size=5),\n      axis.text.x = element_text(size = 8),\n      axis.text.y = element_text(size = 8)))\n\n\n\n\nSince ggstasplot is an extension of ggplot2, it also supports faceting. However the feature is not available in ggcorrmat() but in the grouped_ggcorrmat() of ggstatsplot.\n\ngrouped_ggcorrmat(\n  data = wine,\n  cor.vars = 1:11,\n  grouping.var = type,\n  type = \"robust\",\n  p.adjust.method = \"holm\",\n  plotgrid.args = list(ncol = 2),\n  ggcorrplot.args = list(outline.color = \"black\", \n                         hc.order = TRUE,\n                         tl.cex = 10),\n  annotation.args = list(\n    tag_levels = \"a\",\n    title = \"Correlogram for wine dataset\",\n    subtitle = \"The measures are: alcohol, sulphates, fixed acidity, citric acid, chlorides, residual sugar, density, free sulfur dioxide and volatile acidity\",\n    caption = \"Dataset: UCI Machine Learning Repository\"\n  )\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThings to learn from the code chunk above:\n\nto build a facet plot, the only argument needed is grouping.var.\nBehind group_ggcorrmat(), patchwork package is used to create the multiplot. plotgrid.args argument provides a list of additional arguments passed to patchwork::wrap_plots, except for guides argument which is already separately specified earlier.\nLikewise, annotation.args argument is calling plot annotation arguments of patchwork package."

    "text": "Before we can plot a corrgram using corrplot(), we need to compute the correlation matrix of wine data frame.\nIn the code chunk below, cor() of R Stats is used to compute the correlation matrix of wine data frame.\n\n\nwine.cor &lt;- cor(wine[, 1:11])\n\nNext, corrplot() is used to plot the corrgram by using all the default setting as shown in the code chunk below.\n\ncorrplot(wine.cor)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nThe default visual representation for a corrgram is a circle, displayed in a symmetric matrix layout.\nThe blue-red diverging color scheme represents correlation coefficients, with blue for positive correlations and red for negative correlations.\nThe saturation (intensity) of the color indicates the strength of the correlation, with darker colors representing stronger relationships.\nDarker colors indicate stronger linear correlations, while lighter colors suggest weaker relationships.\nThis visualization helps identify patterns and relationships between multiple variables efficiently.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncorrplot(wine.cor, \n         method = \"ellipse\") \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nThe corrplot package supports seven visual geometries: circle, square, ellipse, number, shade, color, and pie.\nThe default visual representation is a circle, but it can be changed using the method argument.\nThe example uses method = \"ellipse\", which displays correlations as ellipses.\nDifferent geometries help in better understanding correlation patterns based on user preference.\nUsers can experiment with various method options to customize the visualization.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncorrplot(wine.cor, \n         method = \"ellipse\", \n         type=\"lower\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe default layout of the corrgram can be further customised. For example, arguments diag and tl.col are used to turn off the diagonal cells and to change the axis text label colour to black colour respectively as shown in the code chunk and figure below.\n\ncorrplot(wine.cor, \n         method = \"ellipse\", \n         type=\"lower\",\n         diag = FALSE,\n         tl.col = \"black\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith corrplot package, it is possible to design corrgram with mixed visual matrix of one half and numerical matrix on the other half. In order to create a coorgram with mixed layout, the corrplot.mixed(), a wrapped function for mixed visualisation style will be used.\nFigure below shows a mixed layout corrgram plotted using wine quality data.\n\ncorrplot.mixed(wine.cor, \n               lower = \"ellipse\", \n               upper = \"number\",\n               tl.pos = \"lt\",\n               diag = \"l\",\n               tl.col = \"black\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncorrplot.mixed(wine.cor, \n               lower = \"ellipse\", \n               upper = \"number\",\n               tl.pos = \"lt\",\n               diag = \"l\",\n               tl.col = \"black\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nThe lower and upper arguments define the visualization methods for the lower and upper halves of the corrgram.\nIn this example, ellipses are used for the lower half, while numerical values represent correlations in the upper half.\nThe tl.pos argument controls the placement of axis labels.\nThe diag argument specifies the glyph type used on the principal diagonal.\nThis mixed visualization provides both graphical and numerical insights into correlation relationships.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn statistical analysis, it is important to determine which variable pairs have statistically significant correlations. The corrgram shown includes a significance test, revealing that not all correlations are statistically meaningful. For example, the correlation between total sulfur dioxide and free sulfur dioxide is significant at a 0.1 level, while the correlation between total sulfur dioxide and citric acid is not. The black “X” marks indicate non-significant correlations, helping to differentiate meaningful relationships from random associations.\n\nwine.sig = cor.mtest(wine.cor, conf.level= .95)\n\nThen use the p.mat shown below\n\npar(bg = \"#f5f5f5\")\n\ncorrplot(wine.cor,\n         method = \"number\",\n         type = \"lower\",\n         diag = FALSE,\n         tl.col = \"black\",\n         tl.srt = 45,\n         p.mat = wine.sig$p,\n         sig.level = .05,\n         tl.cex = 0.6,\n         bg=\"#f5f5f5\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMatrix reorder is very important for mining the hiden structure and pattern in a corrgram. By default, the order of attributes of a corrgram is sorted according to the correlation matrix (i.e. “original”). The default setting can be over-write by using the order argument of corrplot(). Currently, corrplot package support four sorting methods, they are:\n\n“AOE” is for the angular order of the eigenvectors. See Michael Friendly (2002) for details.\n“FPC” for the first principal component order.\n“hclust” for hierarchical clustering order, and “hclust.method” for the agglomeration method to be used.\n\n“hclust.method” should be one of “ward”, “single”, “complete”, “average”, “mcquitty”, “median” or “centroid”.\n\n“alphabet” for alphabetical order.\n\n“AOE”, “FPC”, “hclust”, “alphabet”. More algorithms can be found in seriation package.\n\ncorrplot.mixed(wine.cor, \n               lower = \"ellipse\", \n               upper = \"number\",\n               tl.pos = \"lt\",\n               diag = \"l\",\n               order=\"AOE\",\n               tl.col = \"black\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncorrplot(wine.cor, \n         method = \"ellipse\", \n         tl.pos = \"lt\",\n         tl.col = \"black\",\n         order=\"hclust\",\n         hclust.method = \"ward.D\",\n         addrect = 3)"

It can be interpreted as a measure of the strength of evidence in favor of one theory among two competing theories.\nThat’s because the Bayes factor gives us a way to evaluate the data in favor of a null hypothesis, and to use external information to do so. It tells us what the weight of the evidence is in favor of a given hypothesis.\nWhen we are comparing two hypotheses, H1 (the alternate hypothesis) and H0 (the null hypothesis), the Bayes Factor is often written as B10. It can be defined mathematically as\n\n\n\nThe Schwarz criterion is one of the easiest ways to calculate rough approximation of the Bayes Factor.\n\n\n\n\nA Bayes Factor can be any positive number. One of the most common interpretations is this one—first proposed by Harold Jeffereys (1961) and slightly modified by Lee and Wagenmakers in 2013:\n\n\n\n\nIn the code chunk below, ggbetweenstats() is used to build a visual for two-sample mean test of Maths scores by gender.\nH0: Mean of Female and Male Math scores are the same.\nH1: Mean of F and M Math scores are not the same.\n\nggbetweenstats(data=exam,\n               x=GENDER,\n               y=MATHS,\n               type='np',        #&lt;&lt; Non-parametric\n               messages=FALSE) +\n  theme(plot.background = element_rect(fill = \"#f5f5f5\", color = \"#f5f2f5\"),\n        legend.background = element_rect(fill=\"#f5f5f5\"),\n        panel.background = element_rect(fill=\"#f5f5f5\"))     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nBased on the Mann-Whitney U test results (p=0.91p = 0.91), the median math scores for males and females are 75 and 74, respectively, with no significant difference. The 95% confidence interval includes zero, indicating little to no effect of gender on math scores. Therefore, we fail to reject the null hypothesis (H₀), suggesting no significant difference in math scores between males and females.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the code chunk below, ggbetweenstats() is used to build a visual for One-way ANOVA test on English score by race.\n\nggbetweenstats(\n  data = exam,\n  x = RACE, \n  y = ENGLISH,\n  type = \"p\",\n  mean.ci = TRUE, \n  pairwise.comparisons = TRUE, \n  pairwise.display = \"s\",\n  p.adjust.method = \"fdr\",\n  messages = FALSE\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nH₀ (Null Hypothesis): The mean English scores across different racial groups are the same (no significant difference).\nH₁ (Alternative Hypothesis): At least one racial group has a different mean English score (significant difference exists).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\n\n\nThe one-way ANOVA shows a significant effect of race on English scores. Chinese and Others groups score higher, while Indian and Malay groups score lower. Pairwise comparisons confirm Chinese scores are significantly higher than Indian and Malay. Since ppp is significant, we reject H₀, indicating a meaningful difference in scores among racial groups.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the code chunk below, ggscatterstats() is used to build a visual for Significant Test of Correlation between Maths scores and English scores.\n\nggscatterstats(\n  data = exam,\n  x = MATHS,\n  y = ENGLISH,\n  marginal = FALSE,\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThe scatter plot shows a strong positive correlation (r=0.83r = 0.83r=0.83) between Maths and English scores. The highly significant p-value (1.70e−831.70e-831.70e−83) confirms this relationship, with a confidence interval of [0.79, 0.86].\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the code chunk below, the Maths scores is binned into a 4-class variable by using cut().\n\nexam1 &lt;- exam %&gt;% \n  mutate(MATHS_bins = \n           cut(MATHS, \n               breaks = c(0,60,75,85,100))\n)\n\nIn this code chunk below ggbarstats() is used to build a visual for Significant Test of Association.\n\nggbarstats(exam1, \n           x = MATHS_bins, \n           y = GENDER)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\nNo significant association between gender and Maths score categories (χ2=1.04,p=0.79^2 = 1.04, p = 0.79χ2=1.04,p=0.79).\nSimilar proportions of Maths scores across genders.\nMaths performance appears independent of gender.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this section, i will learn how to visualise model diagnostic and model parameters by using parameters package.\n\nToyota Corolla case study will be used.

It can be interpreted as a measure of the strength of evidence in favor of one theory among two competing theories.\nThat’s because the Bayes factor gives us a way to evaluate the data in favor of a null hypothesis, and to use external information to do so. It tells us what the weight of the evidence is in favor of a given hypothesis.\nWhen we are comparing two hypotheses, H1 (the alternate hypothesis) and H0 (the null hypothesis), the Bayes Factor is often written as B10. It can be defined mathematically as\n\n\n\nThe Schwarz criterion is one of the easiest ways to calculate rough approximation of the Bayes Factor.\n\n\n\n\nA Bayes Factor can be any positive number. One of the most common interpretations is this one—first proposed by Harold Jeffereys (1961) and slightly modified by Lee and Wagenmakers in 2013:\n\n\n\n\nIn the code chunk below, ggbetweenstats() is used to build a visual for two-sample mean test of Maths scores by gender.\nH0: Mean of Female and Male Math scores are the same.\nH1: Mean of F and M Math scores are not the same.\n\nggbetweenstats(data=exam,\n               x=GENDER,\n               y=MATHS,\n               type='np',        #&lt;&lt; Non-parametric\n               messages=FALSE) +\n  theme(plot.background = element_rect(fill = \"#f5f5f5\", color = \"#f5f2f5\"),\n        legend.background = element_rect(fill=\"#f5f5f5\"),\n        panel.background = element_rect(fill=\"#f5f5f5\"))     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nBased on the Mann-Whitney U test results (p=0.91p = 0.91), the median math scores for males and females are 75 and 74, respectively, with no significant difference. The 95% confidence interval includes zero, indicating little to no effect of gender on math scores. Therefore, we fail to reject the null hypothesis (H₀), suggesting no significant difference in math scores between males and females.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the code chunk below, ggbetweenstats() is used to build a visual for One-way ANOVA test on English score by race.\n\nggbetweenstats(\n  data = exam,\n  x = RACE, \n  y = ENGLISH,\n  type = \"p\",\n  mean.ci = TRUE, \n  pairwise.comparisons = TRUE, \n  pairwise.display = \"s\",\n  p.adjust.method = \"fdr\",\n  messages = FALSE\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nH₀ (Null Hypothesis): The mean English scores across different racial groups are the same (no significant difference).\nH₁ (Alternative Hypothesis): At least one racial group has a different mean English score (significant difference exists).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\n\n\nThe one-way ANOVA shows a significant effect of race on English scores. Chinese and Others groups score higher, while Indian and Malay groups score lower. Pairwise comparisons confirm Chinese scores are significantly higher than Indian and Malay. Since ppp is significant, we reject H₀, indicating a meaningful difference in scores among racial groups.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the code chunk below, ggscatterstats() is used to build a visual for Significant Test of Correlation between Maths scores and English scores.\n\nggscatterstats(\n  data = exam,\n  x = MATHS,\n  y = ENGLISH,\n  marginal = FALSE,\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThe scatter plot shows a strong positive correlation (r=0.83r = 0.83r=0.83) between Maths and English scores. The highly significant p-value (1.70e−831.70e-831.70e−83) confirms this relationship, with a confidence interval of [0.79, 0.86].\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the code chunk below, the Maths scores is binned into a 4-class variable by using cut().\n\nexam1 &lt;- exam %&gt;% \n  mutate(MATHS_bins = \n           cut(MATHS, \n               breaks = c(0,60,75,85,100))\n)\n\nIn this code chunk below ggbarstats() is used to build a visual for Significant Test of Association.\n\nggbarstats(exam1, \n           x = MATHS_bins, \n           y = GENDER)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\nNo significant association between gender and Maths score categories (χ2=1.04,p=0.79^2 = 1.04, p = 0.79χ2=1.04,p=0.79).\nSimilar proportions of Maths scores across genders.\nMaths performance appears independent of gender."

    "text": "When telling a visually-driven data story, animated graphics tends to attract the interest of the audience and make deeper impression than static graphics. In this hands-on exercise, you will learn how to create animated data visualisation by using gganimate and plotly r packages. At the same time, you will also learn how to (i) reshape data by using tidyr package, and (ii) process, wrangle and transform data by using dplyr package.\n\n\nWhen creating animations, the plot does not actually move. Instead, many individual plots are built and then stitched together as movie frames, just like an old-school flip book or cartoon. Each frame is a different plot when conveying motion, which is built using some relevant subset of the aggregate data. The subset drives the flow of the animation when stitched back together.\n\n\n\n\nBefore we dive into the steps for creating an animated statistical graph, it’s important to understand some of the key concepts and terminology related to this type of visualization.\n\nFrame: In an animated line graph, each frame represents a different point in time or a different category. When the frame changes, the data points on the graph are updated to reflect the new data.\nAnimation Attributes: The animation attributes are the settings that control how the animation behaves. For example, you can specify the duration of each frame, the easing function used to transition between frames, and whether to start the animation from the current frame or from the beginning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nTip\nBefore you start making animated graphs, you should first ask yourself: Does it make sense to go through the effort? If you are conducting an exploratory data analysis, an animated graphic may not be worth the time investment. However, if you are giving a presentation, a few well-placed animated graphics can help an audience connect with your topic remarkably better than static counterparts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst, write a code chunk to check, install and load the following R packages:\n\nplotly, R library for plotting interactive statistical graphs.\ngganimate, an ggplot extension for creating animated statistical graphs.\ngifski converts video frames to GIF animations using pngquant’s fancy features for efficient cross-frame palettes and temporal dithering.

It does this by providing a range of new grammar classes that can be added to the plot object in order to customise how it should change with time.\n\ntransition_*() defines how the data should be spread out and how it relates to itself across time.\nview_*() defines how the positional scales should change along the animation.\nshadow_*() defines how data from other points in time should be presented in the given point in time.\nenter_*()/exit_*() defines how new data should appear and how old data should disappear during the course of the animation.\nease_aes() defines how different aesthetics should be eased during transitions.\n\n\n\nIn the code chunk below, the basic ggplot2 functions are used to create a static bubble plot.\n\nggplot(globalPop, aes(x = Old, y = Young, \n                      size = Population, \n                      colour = Country)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.7, \n             show.legend = FALSE) +\n  scale_colour_manual(values = country_colors) +\n  scale_size(range = c(2, 12)) +\n  labs(title = 'Year: {frame_time}', \n       x = '% Aged', \n       y = '% Young') \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the code chunk below,\n\ntransition_time() of gganimate is used to create transition through distinct states in time (i.e. Year).\nease_aes() is used to control easing of aesthetics.

Other methods are: quadratic, cubic, quartic, quintic, sine, circular, exponential, elastic, back, and bounce.\n\n\nggplot(globalPop, aes(x = Old, y = Young, \n                      size = Population, \n                      colour = Country)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.7, \n             show.legend = FALSE) +\n  scale_colour_manual(values = country_colors) +\n  scale_size(range = c(2, 12)) +\n  labs(title = 'Year: {frame_time}', \n       x = '% Aged', \n       y = '% Young') +\n  transition_time(Year) +       \n  ease_aes('linear')          \n\nThe animated bubble chart\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Plotly R package, both ggplotly() and plot_ly() support key frame animations through the frame argument/aesthetic. They also support an ids argument/aesthetic to ensure smooth transitions between objects with the same id (which helps facilitate object constancy).\n\n\nIn this sub-section, you will learn how to create an animated bubble plot by using ggplotly() method.\n\nThe PlotThe Code Chunk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe animated bubble plot above includes a play/pause button and a slider component for controlling the animation\n\n\n\ngg &lt;- ggplot(globalPop, \n       aes(x = Old, \n           y = Young, \n           size = Population, \n           colour = Country)) +\n  geom_point(aes(size = Population,\n                 frame = Year),\n             alpha = 0.7, \n             show.legend = FALSE) +\n  scale_colour_manual(values = country_colors) +\n  scale_size(range = c(2, 12)) +\n  labs(x = '% Aged', \n       y = '% Young')\n\nggplotly(gg)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThings to learn from the code chunk above\n\nAppropriate ggplot2 functions are used to create a static bubble plot.

In this section, I am going to shared with you an ggplot2 extension called patchwork which is specially designed for combining separate ggplot2 graphs into a single figure.\nPatchwork package has a very simple syntax where we can create layouts super easily. Here’s the general syntax that combines:\n\nTwo-Column Layout using the Plus Sign +.\nParenthesis () to create a subplot group.\nTwo-Row Layout using the Division Sign /\n\n\n\n\nFigure in the tabset below shows a composite of two histograms created using patchwork. Note how simple the syntax used to create the plot!\n\nThe PlotThe Code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\np1 + p2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can plot more complex composite by using appropriate operators. For example, the composite figure below is plotted by using:\n\n“/” operator to stack two ggplot2 graphs,\n“|” operator to place the plots beside each other,\n“()” operator the define the sequence of the plotting.\n\n\nThe plotThe code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(p1 / p2) | p3\n\n\n\n\nTo learn more about, refer to Plot Assembly.\n\n\n\nIn order to identify subplots in text, patchwork also provides auto-tagging capabilities as shown in the figure below.\n\nThe plotThe code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n((p1 / p2) | p3) + \n  plot_annotation(tag_levels = 'I')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBeside providing functions to place plots next to each other based on the provided layout. With inset_element() of patchwork, we can place one or several plots or graphic elements freely on top or below another plot.\n\nThe plotThe code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\np3 + inset_element(p2, \n                   left = 0.02, \n                   bottom = 0.7, \n                   right = 0.5, \n                   top = 1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure below is created by combining patchwork and theme_economist() of ggthemes package discussed earlier.\n\nThe plotThe code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npatchwork &lt;- (p1 / p2) | p3\npatchwork & theme_economist()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPatchwork R package goes nerd viral\nggrepel\nggthemes\nhrbrthemes\nggplot tips: Arranging plots\nggplot2 Theme Elements Demonstration\nggplot2 Theme Elements Reference Sheet"

Here’s the general syntax that combines:\n\nTwo-Column Layout using the Plus Sign +.\nParenthesis () to create a subplot group.\nTwo-Row Layout using the Division Sign /\n\n\n\n\nFigure in the tabset below shows a composite of two histograms created using patchwork. Note how simple the syntax used to create the plot!\n\nThe PlotThe Code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\np1 + p2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can plot more complex composite by using appropriate operators. For example, the composite figure below is plotted by using:\n\n“/” operator to stack two ggplot2 graphs,\n“|” operator to place the plots beside each other,\n“()” operator the define the sequence of the plotting.\n\n\nThe plotThe code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(p1 / p2) | p3\n\n\n\n\nTo learn more about, refer to Plot Assembly.\n\n\n\nIn order to identify subplots in text, patchwork also provides auto-tagging capabilities as shown in the figure below.\n\nThe plotThe code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n((p1 / p2) | p3) + \n  plot_annotation(tag_levels = 'I')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBeside providing functions to place plots next to each other based on the provided layout. With inset_element() of patchwork, we can place one or several plots or graphic elements freely on top or below another plot.\n\nThe plotThe code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\np3 + inset_element(p2, \n                   left = 0.02, \n                   bottom = 0.7, \n                   right = 0.5, \n                   top = 1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure below is created by combining patchwork and theme_economist() of ggthemes package discussed earlier.\n\nThe plotThe code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npatchwork &lt;- (p1 / p2) | p3\npatchwork & theme_economist()"

    "text": "In this hands-on exercise, you will learn how to create interactive data visualisation by using functions provided by ggiraph and plotlyr packages.\n\n\n\nFirst, write a code chunk to check, install and launch the following R packages:\n\nggiraph for making ‘ggplot’ graphics interactive.\nplotly, R library for plotting interactive statistical graphs.\nDT provides an R interface to the JavaScript library DataTables that create interactive table on html page.\ntidyverse, a family of modern R packages specially designed to support data science, analysis and communication task including creating static statistical graphs.\npatchwork for combining multiple ggplot2 graphs into one figure.\n\nThe code chunk below will be used to accomplish the task.\n\npacman::p_load(ggiraph, plotly, \n               patchwork, DT, tidyverse) \n\n\n\n\nIn this section, Exam_data.csv provided will be used. Using read_csv() of readr package, import Exam_data.csv into R.\nThe code chunk below read.csv() of readr package is used to import Exam_data.csv data file into R and save it as an tibble data frame called exam_data.\n\nexam_data &lt;- read.csv(\"data/Exam_data.csv\")\n\n\n\n\nggiraph  is an htmlwidget and a ggplot2 extension. It allows ggplot graphics to be interactive.\nInteractive is made with ggplot geometries that can understand three arguments:\n\nTooltip: a column of data-sets that contain tooltips to be displayed when the mouse is over elements.\nOnclick: a column of data-sets that contain a JavaScript function to be executed when elements are clicked.\nData_id: a column of data-sets that contain an id to be associated with elements.\n\nIf it used within a shiny application, elements associated with an id (data_id) can be selected and manipulated on client and server sides. Refer to this article for more detail explanation.\n\n\nBelow shows a typical code chunk to plot an interactive statistical graph by using ggiraph package. Notice that the code chunk consists of two parts. First, an ggplot object will be created. Next, girafe() of ggiraph will be used to create an interactive svg object.\n\np &lt;- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_dotplot_interactive(\n    aes(tooltip = ID),\n    stackgroups = TRUE, \n    binwidth = 1, \n    method = \"histodot\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(NULL, \n                     breaks = NULL)\ngirafe(\n  ggobj = p,\n  width_svg = 6,\n  height_svg = 6*0.618\n)\n\nNotice that two steps are involved. First, an interactive version of ggplot2 geom (i.e. geom_dotplot_interactive()) will be used to create the basic graph. Then, girafe() will be used to generate an svg object to be displayed on an html page.\n\n\n\n\nBy hovering the mouse pointer on an data point of interest, the student’s ID will be displayed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe content of the tooltip can be customised by including a list object as shown in the code chunk below.\n\nexam_data$tooltip &lt;- c(paste0(     \n  \"Name = \", exam_data$ID,         \n  \"\\n Class = \", exam_data$CLASS)) \n\np &lt;- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_dotplot_interactive(\n    aes(tooltip = exam_data$tooltip), \n    stackgroups = TRUE,\n    binwidth = 1,\n    method = \"histodot\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(NULL,               \n                     breaks = NULL)\ngirafe(\n  ggobj = p,\n  width_svg = 8,\n  height_svg = 8*0.618\n)\n\nThe first three lines of codes in the code chunk create a new field called tooltip. At the same time, it populates text in ID and CLASS fields into the newly created field. Next, this newly created field is used as tooltip field as shown in the code of line 7.\n\n\n\n\nBy hovering the mouse pointer on an data point of interest, the student’s ID and Class will be displayed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode chunk below uses opts_tooltip() of ggiraph to customize tooltip rendering by add css declarations.\n\ntooltip_css &lt;- \"background-color:white; #&lt;&lt;\nfont-style:bold; color:black;\" #&lt;&lt;\n\np &lt;- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_dotplot_interactive(              \n    aes(tooltip = ID),                   \n    stackgroups = TRUE,                  \n    binwidth = 1,                        \n    method = \"histodot\") +               \n  scale_y_continuous(NULL,               \n                     breaks = NULL)\ngirafe(                                  \n  ggobj = p,                             \n  width_svg = 6,                         \n  height_svg = 6*0.618,\n  options = list(    #&lt;&lt;\n    opts_tooltip(    #&lt;&lt;\n      css = tooltip_css)) #&lt;&lt;\n)                                        \n\nNotice that the background colour of the tooltip is black and the font colour is white and bold.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRefer to Customizing girafe objects to learn more about how to customise ggiraph objects.\n\n\n\n\nCode chunk below shows an advanced way to customise tooltip. In this example, a function is used to compute 90% confident interval of the mean. The derived statistics are then displayed in the tooltip.\n\ntooltip &lt;- function(y, ymax, accuracy = .01) {\n  mean &lt;- scales::number(y, accuracy = accuracy)\n  sem &lt;- scales::number(ymax - y, accuracy = accuracy)\n  paste(\"Mean maths scores:\", mean, \"+/-\", sem)\n}\n\ngg_point &lt;- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n                   aes(x = RACE),\n) +\n  stat_summary(aes(y = MATHS, \n                   tooltip = after_stat(  \n                     tooltip(y, ymax))),  \n    fun.data = \"mean_se\", \n    geom = GeomInteractiveCol,  \n    fill = \"light blue\"\n  ) +\n  stat_summary(aes(y = MATHS),\n    fun.data = mean_se,\n    geom = \"errorbar\", width = 0.2, size = 0.2\n  )\n\ngirafe(ggobj = gg_point,\n       width_svg = 8,\n       height_svg = 8*0.618)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode chunk below shows the second interactive feature of ggiraph, namely data_id.\n\np &lt;- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_dotplot_interactive(           \n    aes(data_id = CLASS),             \n    stackgroups = TRUE,               \n    binwidth = 1,                        \n    method = \"histodot\") +               \n  scale_y_continuous(NULL,               \n                     breaks = NULL)\ngirafe(                                  \n  ggobj = p,                             \n  width_svg = 6,                         \n  height_svg = 6*0.618                      \n)                                        \n\nInteractivity: Elements associated with a data_id (i.e CLASS) will be highlighted upon mouse over.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that the default value of the hover css is hover_css = “fill:orange;”.\n\n\n\nIn the code chunk below, css codes are used to change the highlighting effect.\n\np &lt;- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_dotplot_interactive(              \n    aes(data_id = CLASS),              \n    stackgroups = TRUE,                  \n    binwidth = 1,                        \n    method = \"histodot\") +               \n  scale_y_continuous(NULL,               \n                     breaks = NULL)\ngirafe(                                  \n  ggobj = p,                             \n  width_svg = 6,                         \n  height_svg = 6*0.618,\n  options = list(                        \n    opts_hover(css = \"fill: #202020;\"),  \n    opts_hover_inv(css = \"opacity:0.2;\") \n  )                                        \n)                                        \n\nInteractivity: Elements associated with a data_id (i.e CLASS) will be highlighted upon mouse over.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: Different from previous example, in this example the ccs customisation request are encoded directly.\n\n\n\nThere are time that we want to combine tooltip and hover effect on the interactive statistical graph as shown in the code chunk below.\n\np &lt;- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_dotplot_interactive(              \n    aes(tooltip = CLASS, \n        data_id = CLASS),              \n    stackgroups = TRUE,                  \n    binwidth = 1,                        \n    method = \"histodot\") +               \n  scale_y_continuous(NULL,               \n                     breaks = NULL)\ngirafe(                                  \n  ggobj = p,                             \n  width_svg = 6,                         \n  height_svg = 6*0.618,\n  options = list(                        \n    opts_hover(css = \"fill: #202020;\"),  \n    opts_hover_inv(css = \"opacity:0.2;\") \n  )                                        \n)                                        \n\nInteractivity: Elements associated with a data_id (i.e CLASS) will be highlighted upon mouse over.

It sets a variety of options for brushing (i.e., highlighting) multiple plots. These options are primarily designed for linking multiple plotly graphs, and may not behave as expected when linking plotly to another htmlwidget package via crosstalk. In some cases, other htmlwidgets will respect these options, such as persistent selection in leaflet.\nbscols() is a helper function of crosstalk package. It makes it easy to put HTML elements side by side. It can be called directly from the console but is especially designed to work in an R Markdown document. Warning: This will bring in all of Bootstrap!.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis link provides online version of the reference guide and several useful articles.

    "text": "ggiraph  is an htmlwidget and a ggplot2 extension. It allows ggplot graphics to be interactive.\nInteractive is made with ggplot geometries that can understand three arguments:\n\nTooltip: a column of data-sets that contain tooltips to be displayed when the mouse is over elements.\nOnclick: a column of data-sets that contain a JavaScript function to be executed when elements are clicked.\nData_id: a column of data-sets that contain an id to be associated with elements.\n\nIf it used within a shiny application, elements associated with an id (data_id) can be selected and manipulated on client and server sides. Refer to this article for more detail explanation.\n\n\nBelow shows a typical code chunk to plot an interactive statistical graph by using ggiraph package. Notice that the code chunk consists of two parts. First, an ggplot object will be created. Next, girafe() of ggiraph will be used to create an interactive svg object.\n\np &lt;- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_dotplot_interactive(\n    aes(tooltip = ID),\n    stackgroups = TRUE, \n    binwidth = 1, \n    method = \"histodot\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(NULL, \n                     breaks = NULL)\ngirafe(\n  ggobj = p,\n  width_svg = 6,\n  height_svg = 6*0.618\n)\n\nNotice that two steps are involved. First, an interactive version of ggplot2 geom (i.e. geom_dotplot_interactive()) will be used to create the basic graph. Then, girafe() will be used to generate an svg object to be displayed on an html page."

In this section, i will learn how to plot ridgeline plot by using ggridges package.\nggridges package provides two main geom to plot gridgeline plots, they are: geom_ridgeline() and geom_density_ridges().

    "text": "3.2 Varying fill colors along the x axis\nSometimes we would like to have the area under a ridgeline not filled with a single solid color but rather with colors that vary in some form along the x axis. This effect can be achieved by using either geom_ridgeline_gradient() or geom_density_ridges_gradient(). Both geoms work just like geom_ridgeline() and geom_density_ridges(), except that they allow for varying fill colors. However, they do not allow for alpha transparency in the fill.

The overlapping design makes it easy to compare trends across groups, though some areas may be difficult to distinguish due to excessive overlap. A shared legend for color intensity and slight adjustments to opacity or spacing could further enhance readability.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.3 Mapping the probabilities directly onto colour\nBeside providing additional geom objects to support the need to plot ridgeline plot, ggridges package also provides a stat function called stat_density_ridges() that replaces stat_density() of ggplot2.\nFigure below is plotted by mapping the probabilities calculated by using stat(ecdf) which represent the empirical cumulative density function for the distribution of English score.\n\nThe plotThe code chunk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(exam,\n       aes(x = ENGLISH, \n           y = CLASS, \n           fill = 0.5 - abs(0.5-stat(ecdf)))) +\n  stat_density_ridges(geom = \"density_ridges_gradient\", \n                      calc_ecdf = TRUE) +\n  scale_fill_viridis_c(name = \"Tail probability\",\n                       direction = -1) +\n  theme_ridges()+\n  labs(x = \"English\",\n       y = \"\",\n       title=\"Uneven distribution across classes.\") +   \n  theme(\n    #legend.position = \"none\",\n    #panel.grid.major = element_blank(),\n    axis.title.y = element_blank(),\n    plot.background = element_rect(fill=\"#f5f5f5\",colour=\"#f5f5f5\")  \n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nInsights:\n\nThe distribution of English scores varies across classes, with some showing a more even spread while others have concentrated peaks.

    "text": "Heatmaps visualise data through variations in colouring. When applied to a tabular format, heatmaps are useful for cross-examining multivariate data, through placing variables in the columns and observation (or records) in rowa and colouring the cells within the table. Heatmaps are good for showing variance across multiple variables, revealing any patterns, displaying whether any variables are similar to each other, and for detecting if any correlations exist in-between them.\nIn this hands-on exercise, I have gain hands-on experience on using R to plot static and interactive heatmap for visualising and analysing multivariate data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nHeatmaps visualize data through color variations, making it easy to analyze multivariate data.\nThey help detect patterns, correlations, and relationships between variables.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstall PackagesImporting DataTransforming the Data frame into a matrix\n\n\nBefore getting started, we are required to open a new Quarto document.

It draws a simple heatmap.\nheatmap.2() of gplots R package. It draws an enhanced heatmap compared to the R base function.\npheatmap() of pheatmap R package. pheatmap package also known as Pretty Heatmap. The package provides functions to draws pretty heatmaps and provides more control to change the appearance of heatmaps.\nComplexHeatmap package of R/Bioconductor package. The package draws, annotates and arranges complex heatmaps (very useful for genomic data analysis). The full reference guide of the package is available here.\nsuperheat package: A Graphical Tool for Exploring Complex Datasets Using Heatmaps. A system for generating extendable and customizable heatmaps for exploring complex datasets, including big data and data with multiple data types. The full reference guide of the package is available here.\n\nIn this section, you will learn how to plot static heatmaps by using heatmap() of R Stats package.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nDifferent R packages provide static heatmaps, including heatmap(), heatmap.2(), pheatmap(), and ComplexHeatmap.\nheatmap() is the base R function, which can cluster data by default unless disabled.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this sub-section, we will plot a heatmap by using heatmap() of Base Stats. The code chunk is given below.\n\nwh_heatmap &lt;- heatmap(wh_matrix,\n                      Rowv=NA, Colv=NA)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nNote:\n\nBy default, heatmap() plots a cluster heatmap. The arguments Rowv=NA and Colv=NA are used to switch off the option of plotting the row and column dendrograms.\nheatmap() automatically reorders rows/columns using hierarchical clustering.\nNormalization (scaling) improves readability by adjusting variable ranges.\n\n\n\nTo plot a cluster heatmap, we just have to use the default as shown in the code chunk below.\n\nwh_heatmap &lt;- heatmap(wh_matrix)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nNote:\n\nThe order of both rows and columns is different compare to the native wh_matrix. This is because heatmap do a reordering using clusterisation: it calculates the distance between each pair of rows and columns and try to order them by similarity. Moreover, the corresponding dendrogram are provided beside the heatmap.\n\nHere, red cells denotes small values, and red small ones. This heatmap is not really informative. Indeed, the Happiness Score variable have relatively higher values, what makes that the other variables with small values all look the same. Thus, we need to normalize this matrix.

It is designed and maintained by Tal Galili.\nBefore we get started, you should review the Introduction to Heatmaply to have an overall understanding of the features and functions of Heatmaply package. You are also required to have the user manualof the package handy with you for reference purposes.\nIn this section, you will gain hands-on experience on using heatmaply to design an interactive cluster heatmap. We will still use the wh_matrix as the input data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nheatmaply allows interactive heatmaps that can be exported as HTML.\nThe package provides improved usability and interactivity compared to static heatmaps.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nheatmaply(mtcars)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below shows the basic syntax needed to create n interactive heatmap by using heatmaply package.\n\nheatmaply(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)])\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nNote that:\n\nDifferent from heatmap(), for heatmaply() the default horizontal dendrogram is placed on the left hand side of the heatmap.\nThe text label of each raw, on the other hand, is placed on the right hand side of the heat map.\nWhen the x-axis marker labels are too long, they will be rotated by 135 degree from the north.\nThe function heatmaply() generates an interactive heatmap with automatic clustering.\nLabels and dendrograms are placed differently than in base R’s heatmap().\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen analysing multivariate data set, it is very common that the variables in the data sets includes values that reflect different types of measurement. In general, these variables’ values have their own range. In order to ensure that all the variables have comparable values, data transformation are commonly used before clustering.\nThree main data transformation methods are supported by heatmaply(), namely: scale, normalise and percentilse.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nEnsures that different variables are on a comparable scale for clustering.\nThree common methods: scaling, normalization, and percentilizing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen all variables are came from or assumed to come from some normal distribution, then scaling (i.e.: subtract the mean and divide by the standard deviation) would bring them all close to the standard normal distribution.\nIn such a case, each value would reflect the distance from the mean in units of standard deviation.\nThe scale argument in heatmaply() supports column and row scaling.\n\nThe code chunk below is used to scale variable values columewise.\n\nheatmaply(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)],\n          scale = \"column\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nAdjusts values to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.\nBest used when variables follow a normal distribution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen variables in the data comes from possibly different (and non-normal) distributions, the normalize function can be used to bring data to the 0 to 1 scale by subtracting the minimum and dividing by the maximum of all observations.\nThis preserves the shape of each variable’s distribution while making them easily comparable on the same “scale”.\n\nDifferent from Scaling, the normalise method is performed on the input data set i.e. wh_matrix as shown in the code chunk below.\n\nheatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is similar to ranking the variables, but instead of keeping the rank values, divide them by the maximal rank.\nThis is done by using the ecdf of the variables on their own values, bringing each value to its empirical percentile.\nThe benefit of the percentize function is that each value has a relatively clear interpretation, it is the percent of observations that got that value or below it.\n\nSimilar to Normalize method, the Percentize method is also performed on the input data set i.e. wh_matrix as shown in the code chunk below.\n\nheatmaply(percentize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nheatmaply supports a variety of hierarchical clustering algorithm. The main arguments provided are:\n\ndistfun: function used to compute the distance (dissimilarity) between both rows and columns. Defaults to dist. The options “pearson”, “spearman” and “kendall” can be used to use correlation-based clustering, which uses as.dist(1 - cor(t(x))) as the distance metric (using the specified correlation method).\nhclustfun: function used to compute the hierarchical clustering when Rowv or Colv are not dendrograms. Defaults to hclust.\ndist_method default is NULL, which results in “euclidean” to be used. It can accept alternative character strings indicating the method to be passed to distfun. By default distfun is “dist”” hence this can be one of “euclidean”, “maximum”, “manhattan”, “canberra”, “binary” or “minkowski”.\nhclust_method default is NULL, which results in “complete” method to be used. It can accept alternative character strings indicating the method to be passed to hclustfun. By default hclustfun is hclust hence this can be one of “ward.D”, “ward.D2”, “single”, “complete”, “average” (= UPGMA), “mcquitty” (= WPGMA), “median” (= WPGMC) or “centroid” (= UPGMC).\n\nIn general, a clustering model can be calibrated either manually or statistically.\n\n\n\nIn the code chunk below, the heatmap is plotted by using hierachical clustering algorithm with “Euclidean distance” and “ward.D” method.\n\nheatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]),\n          dist_method = \"euclidean\",\n          hclust_method = \"ward.D\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to determine the best clustering method and number of cluster the dend_expend() and find_k() functions of dendextend package will be used.\nFirst, the dend_expend() will be used to determine the recommended clustering method to be used.\n\nwh_d &lt;- dist(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]), method = \"euclidean\")\ndend_expend(wh_d)[[3]]\n\n  dist_methods hclust_methods     optim\n1      unknown         ward.D 0.6137851\n2      unknown        ward.D2 0.6289186\n3      unknown         single 0.4774362\n4      unknown       complete 0.6434009\n5      unknown        average 0.6701688\n6      unknown       mcquitty 0.5020102\n7      unknown         median 0.5901833\n8      unknown       centroid 0.6338734\n\n\nThe output table shows that “average” method should be used because it gave the high optimum value.\nNext, find_k() is used to determine the optimal number of cluster.\n\nwh_clust &lt;- hclust(wh_d, method = \"average\")\nnum_k &lt;- find_k(wh_clust)\nplot(num_k)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure above shows that k=3 would be good.\nWith reference to the statistical analysis results, we can prepare the code chunk as shown below.\n\nheatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]),\n          dist_method = \"euclidean\",\n          hclust_method = \"average\",\n          k_row = 3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the problems with hierarchical clustering is that it doesn’t actually place the rows in a definite order, it merely constrains the space of possible orderings. Take three items A, B and C. If you ignore reflections, there are three possible orderings: ABC, ACB, BAC. If clustering them gives you ((A+B)+C) as a tree, you know that C can’t end up between A and B, but it doesn’t tell you which way to flip the A+B cluster. It doesn’t tell you if the ABC ordering will lead to a clearer-looking heatmap than the BAC ordering.\nheatmaply uses the seriation package to find an optimal ordering of rows and columns. Optimal means to optimize the Hamiltonian path length that is restricted by the dendrogram structure. This, in other words, means to rotate the branches so that the sum of distances between each adjacent leaf (label) will be minimized. This is related to a restricted version of the travelling salesman problem.\nHere we meet our first seriation algorithm: Optimal Leaf Ordering (OLO). This algorithm starts with the output of an agglomerative clustering algorithm and produces a unique ordering, one that flips the various branches of the dendrogram around so as to minimize the sum of dissimilarities between adjacent leaves. Here is the result of applying Optimal Leaf Ordering to the same clustering result as the heatmap above.\n\nheatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]),\n          seriate = \"OLO\")\n\n\n\n\n\nThe default options is “OLO” (Optimal leaf ordering) which optimizes the above criterion (in O(n^4)). Another option is “GW” (Gruvaeus and Wainer) which aims for the same goal but uses a potentially faster heuristic.\n\nheatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]),\n          seriate = \"GW\")\n\n\n\n\n\nThe option “mean” gives the output we would get by default from heatmap functions in other packages such as gplots::heatmap.2.\n\nheatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]),\n          seriate = \"mean\")\n\n\n\n\n\nThe option “none” gives us the dendrograms without any rotation that is based on the data matrix.\n\nheatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]),\n          seriate = \"none\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe default colour palette uses by heatmaply is viridis. heatmaply users, however, can use other colour palettes in order to improve the aestheticness and visual friendliness of the heatmap.\nIn the code chunk below, the Blues colour palette of rColorBrewer is used\n\nheatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]),\n          seriate = \"none\",\n          colors = Blues)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBeside providing a wide collection of arguments for meeting the statistical analysis needs, heatmaply also provides many plotting features to ensure cartographic quality heatmap can be produced.\nIn the code chunk below the following arguments are used:\n\nk_row is used to produce 5 groups.\nmargins is used to change the top margin to 60 and row margin to 200.\nfontsizw_row and fontsize_col are used to change the font size for row and column labels to 4.\nmain is used to write the main title of the plot.\nxlab and ylab are used to write the x-axis and y-axis labels respectively.\n\n\nheatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]),\n          Colv=NA,\n          seriate = \"none\",\n          colors = Blues,\n          k_row = 5,\n          margins = c(NA,200,60,NA),\n          fontsize_row = 4,\n          fontsize_col = 5,\n          main=\"World Happiness Score and Variables by Country, 2018 \\nDataTransformation using Normalise Method\",\n          xlab = \"World Happiness Indicators\",\n          ylab = \"World Countries\"\n          )"

Another option is “GW” (Gruvaeus and Wainer) which aims for the same goal but uses a potentially faster heuristic.\n\nheatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]),\n          seriate = \"GW\")\n\n\n\n\n\nThe option “mean” gives the output we would get by default from heatmap functions in other packages such as gplots::heatmap.2.\n\nheatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]),\n          seriate = \"mean\")\n\n\n\n\n\nThe option “none” gives us the dendrograms without any rotation that is based on the data matrix.\n\nheatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]),\n          seriate = \"none\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe default colour palette uses by heatmaply is viridis. heatmaply users, however, can use other colour palettes in order to improve the aestheticness and visual friendliness of the heatmap.\nIn the code chunk below, the Blues colour palette of rColorBrewer is used\n\nheatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]),\n          seriate = \"none\",\n          colors = Blues)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBeside providing a wide collection of arguments for meeting the statistical analysis needs, heatmaply also provides many plotting features to ensure cartographic quality heatmap can be produced.\nIn the code chunk below the following arguments are used:\n\nk_row is used to produce 5 groups.\nmargins is used to change the top margin to 60 and row margin to 200.\nfontsizw_row and fontsize_col are used to change the font size for row and column labels to 4.\nmain is used to write the main title of the plot.\nxlab and ylab are used to write the x-axis and y-axis labels respectively.\n\n\nheatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]),\n          Colv=NA,\n          seriate = \"none\",\n          colors = Blues,\n          k_row = 5,\n          margins = c(NA,200,60,NA),\n          fontsize_row = 4,\n          fontsize_col = 5,\n          main=\"World Happiness Score and Variables by Country, 2018 \\nDataTransformation using Normalise Method\",\n          xlab = \"World Happiness Indicators\",\n          ylab = \"World Countries\"\n          )"

In this section, we will perform the following steps to manipulate and prepare a data.frtame that is appropriate for treemap visualisation:\n\ngroup transaction records by Project Name, Planning Region, Planning Area, Property Type and Type of Sale, and\ncompute Total Unit Sold, Total Area, Median Unit Price and Median Transacted Price by applying appropriate summary statistics on No. of Units, Area (sqm), Unit Price ($ psm) and Transacted Price ($) respectively.\n\nTwo key verbs of dplyr package, namely: group_by() and summarize() will be used to perform these steps.\ngroup_by() breaks down a data.frame into specified groups of rows. When you then apply the verbs above on the resulting object they’ll be automatically applied “by group”.\nGrouping affects the verbs as follows:\n\ngrouped select() is the same as ungrouped select(), except that grouping variables are always retained.\ngrouped arrange() is the same as ungrouped; unless you set .by_group = TRUE, in which case it orders first by the grouping variables.\nmutate() and filter() are most useful in conjunction with window functions (like rank(), or min(x) == x). They are described in detail in vignette(“window-functions”).\nsample_n() and sample_frac() sample the specified number/fraction of rows in each group.\nsummarise() computes the summary for each group.\n\nIn our case, group_by() will used together with summarise() to derive the summarised data.frame.\n\nrealis2018_summarised &lt;- realis2018 %&gt;%\n  group_by(`Project Name`, `Planning Region`,\n           `Planning Area`, `Property Type`,\n           `Type of Sale`) %&gt;%\n  summarise(\n    `Total Unit Sold` = sum(`No. of Units`, na.rm = TRUE),\n    `Total Area` = sum(`Area (sqm)`, na.rm = TRUE),\n    `Median Unit Price ($ psm)` = median(`Unit Price ($ psm)`, na.rm = TRUE),\n    `Median Transacted Price` = median(`Transacted Price ($)`, na.rm = TRUE),\n    .groups = \"drop_last\"   # This keeps the last grouping level\n  )\n\nThe code chunk above shows a more efficient way to tackle the same processes by using the pipe, %&gt;%\n\nhead(realis2018_summarised)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 9\n# Groups:   Project Name, Planning Region, Planning Area, Property Type [6]\n  `Project Name`     `Planning Region` `Planning Area` `Property Type`      \n  &lt;chr&gt;              &lt;chr&gt;             &lt;chr&gt;           &lt;chr&gt;                \n1 # 1 LOFT           Central Region    Geylang         Apartment            \n2 # 1 SUITES         Central Region    Geylang         Apartment            \n3 1 CANBERRA         North Region      Yishun          Executive Condominium\n4 1 KING ALBERT PARK Central Region    Bukit Timah     Condominium          \n5 10 EVELYN          Central Region    Novena          Apartment            \n6 10 SHELFORD        Central Region    Bukit Timah     Apartment            \n# ℹ 5 more variables: `Type of Sale` &lt;chr&gt;, `Total Unit Sold` &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   `Total Area` &lt;dbl&gt;, `Median Unit Price ($ psm)` &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   `Median Transacted Price` &lt;dbl&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this section, treemap() of Treemap package is used to plot a treemap showing the distribution of median unit prices and total unit sold of resale condominium by geographic hierarchy in 2017.\nFirst, we will select records belongs to resale condominium property type from realis2018_selected data frame.\n\nrealis2018_selected &lt;- realis2018_summarised %&gt;%\n  filter(`Property Type` == \"Condominium\", `Type of Sale` == \"Resale\")\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below designed a treemap by using three core arguments of treemap(), namely: index, vSize and vColor.\n\ntreemap(realis2018_selected,\n        index=c(\"Planning Region\", \"Planning Area\", \"Project Name\"),\n        vSize=\"Total Unit Sold\",\n        vColor=\"Median Unit Price ($ psm)\",\n        title=\"Resale Condominium by Planning Region and Area, 2017\",\n        title.legend = \"Median Unit Price (S$ per sq. m)\"\n        )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThings to learn from the three arguments used:\n\nindex\n\nThe index vector must consist of at least two column names or else no hierarchy treemap will be plotted.\nIf multiple column names are provided, such as the code chunk above, the first name is the highest aggregation level, the second name the second highest aggregation level, and so on.\n\nvSize\n\nThe column must not contain negative values. This is because it’s vaues will be used to map the sizes of the rectangles of the treemaps.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nWarning:\nThe treemap above was wrongly coloured. For a correctly designed treemap, the colours of the rectagles should be in different intensity showing, in our case, median unit prices.\nFor treemap(), vColor is used in combination with the argument type to determines the colours of the rectangles. Without defining type, like the code chunk above, treemap() assumes type = index, in our case, the hierarchy of planning areas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntreemap(realis2018_selected,\n        index=c(\"Planning Region\", \"Planning Area\", \"Project Name\"),\n        vSize=\"Total Unit Sold\",\n        vColor=\"Median Unit Price ($ psm)\",\n        type = \"value\",\n        title=\"Resale Condominium by Planning Region and Area, 2017\",\n        title.legend = \"Median Unit Price (S$ per sq. m)\"\n        )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThinking to learn from the conde chunk above.\n\nThe rectangles are coloured with different intensity of green, reflecting their respective median unit prices.\nThe legend reveals that the values are binned into ten bins, i.e. 0-5000, 5000-10000, etc. with an equal interval of 5000.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe mapping and palette arguments control color assignment in treemaps. The key difference between \"value\" and \"manual\" lies in how colors are mapped to values:\n\n“value” mapping: Uses a diverging color palette (e.g., \"RdYlBu\") where 0 is assigned the middle color, negative values the left-end color, and positive values the right-end color based on their absolute range.\n“manual” mapping: Assigns the minimum value to the left-end color, the maximum to the right-end color, and the midpoint of the range to the middle color.\n\nEssentially, \"value\" emphasizes deviation from zero, while \"manual\" spreads colors evenly across the data range.\n\nThe “Value” TreeemapThe “Manual” Treemap\n\n\n\ntreemap(realis2018_selected,\n        index=c(\"Planning Region\", \"Planning Area\", \"Project Name\"),\n        vSize=\"Total Unit Sold\",\n        vColor=\"Median Unit Price ($ psm)\",\n        type=\"value\",\n        palette=\"RdYlBu\", \n        title=\"Resale Condominium by Planning Region and Area, 2017\",\n        title.legend = \"Median Unit Price (S$ per sq. m)\"\n        )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThing to learn from the code chunk above:\n\nalthough the colour palette used is RdYlBu but there are no red rectangles in the treemap above. This is because all the median unit prices are positive.\nThe reason why we see only 5000 to 45000 in the legend is because the range argument is by default c(min(values, max(values)) with some pretty rounding.\n\n\n\n\ntreemap(realis2018_selected,\n        index=c(\"Planning Region\", \"Planning Area\", \"Project Name\"),\n        vSize=\"Total Unit Sold\",\n        vColor=\"Median Unit Price ($ psm)\",\n        type=\"manual\",\n        palette=\"RdYlBu\", \n        title=\"Resale Condominium by Planning Region and Area, 2017\",\n        title.legend = \"Median Unit Price (S$ per sq. m)\"\n        )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThings to learn from the code chunk above:\n\nThe colour scheme used is very copnfusing. This is because mapping = (min(values), mean(range(values)), max(values)). It is not wise to use diverging colour palette such as RdYlBu if the values are all positive or negative\n\nTo overcome this problem, a single colour palette such as Blues should be used.\n\ntreemap(realis2018_selected,\n        index=c(\"Planning Region\", \"Planning Area\", \"Project Name\"),\n        vSize=\"Total Unit Sold\",\n        vColor=\"Median Unit Price ($ psm)\",\n        type=\"manual\",\n        palette=\"Blues\", \n        title=\"Resale Condominium by Planning Region and Area, 2017\",\n        title.legend = \"Median Unit Price (S$ per sq. m)\"\n        )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe treemap() function supports two layout algorithms: “squarified” and “pivotSize” (default).\n\n“squarified” (Bruls et al., 2000) optimizes aspect ratios for better readability but ignores the sorting order of rectangles.\n“pivotSize” (Bederson et al., 2002) maintains a reasonable aspect ratio while preserving the sorting order (sortID).\n\nEssentially, “squarified” prioritizes shape balance, while “pivotSize” ensures a meaningful order in the layout.\n\nAlgorithm ArgumentUsing SortID\n\n\n\ntreemap(realis2018_selected,\n        index=c(\"Planning Region\", \"Planning Area\", \"Project Name\"),\n        vSize=\"Total Unit Sold\",\n        vColor=\"Median Unit Price ($ psm)\",\n        type=\"manual\",\n        palette=\"Blues\", \n        algorithm = \"squarified\", #&lt;&lt;&lt;\n        title=\"Resale Condominium by Planning Region and Area, 2017\",\n        title.legend = \"Median Unit Price (S$ per sq. m)\"\n        )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen “pivotSize” algorithm is used, sortID argument can be used to dertemine the order in which the rectangles are placed from top left to bottom right.\n\ntreemap(realis2018_selected,\n        index=c(\"Planning Region\", \"Planning Area\", \"Project Name\"),\n        vSize=\"Total Unit Sold\",\n        vColor=\"Median Unit Price ($ psm)\",\n        type=\"manual\",\n        palette=\"Blues\", \n        algorithm = \"pivotSize\",\n        sortID = \"Median Transacted Price\",\n        title=\"Resale Condominium by Planning Region and Area, 2017\",\n        title.legend = \"Median Unit Price (S$ per sq. m)\"\n        )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntreemapify is a R package specially developed to draw treemaps in ggplot2.\n\n\nStep 1: Plot the simple treemap with ggplot() and geom_treemap().\n\nggplot(data=realis2018_selected, \n       aes(area = `Total Unit Sold`,\n           fill = `Median Unit Price ($ psm)`),\n       layout = \"scol\",\n       start = \"bottomleft\") + \n  geom_treemap() +\n  scale_fill_gradient(low = \"light blue\", high = \"blue\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 2: Group by Planning Region\n\nggplot(data=realis2018_selected, \n       aes(area = `Total Unit Sold`,\n           fill = `Median Unit Price ($ psm)`,\n           subgroup = `Planning Region`),\n       start = \"topleft\") + \n      geom_treemap() +\n      theme(\n      plot.title = element_text(hjust=0, family = \"Bold\"),\n      plot.background = element_rect(fill = \"#f5f5f5\", color = \"#f5f2f5\"),\n      legend.background = element_rect(fill=\"#f5f5f5\"),\n      panel.background = element_rect(fill=\"#f5f5f5\"))   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 3: Adding boundary line!\n\nggplot(data=realis2018_selected, \n       aes(area = `Total Unit Sold`,\n           fill = `Median Unit Price ($ psm)`,\n           subgroup = `Planning Region`,\n           subgroup2 = `Planning Area`)) + \n  geom_treemap() +\n  geom_treemap_subgroup2_border(colour = \"gray40\",\n                                size = 2) +\n  geom_treemap_subgroup_border(colour = \"gray20\") \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlibrary(devtools)\n\ninstall_github(\"timelyportfolio/d3treeR\")\nlibrary(d3treeR)\n\n\n\n\nThe codes below perform two processes.\n\ntreemap() is used to build a treemap by using selected variables in condominium data.frame.

In this section, we will perform the following steps to manipulate and prepare a data.frtame that is appropriate for treemap visualisation:\n\ngroup transaction records by Project Name, Planning Region, Planning Area, Property Type and Type of Sale, and\ncompute Total Unit Sold, Total Area, Median Unit Price and Median Transacted Price by applying appropriate summary statistics on No. of Units, Area (sqm), Unit Price ($ psm) and Transacted Price ($) respectively.\n\nTwo key verbs of dplyr package, namely: group_by() and summarize() will be used to perform these steps.\ngroup_by() breaks down a data.frame into specified groups of rows. When you then apply the verbs above on the resulting object they’ll be automatically applied “by group”.\nGrouping affects the verbs as follows:\n\ngrouped select() is the same as ungrouped select(), except that grouping variables are always retained.\ngrouped arrange() is the same as ungrouped; unless you set .by_group = TRUE, in which case it orders first by the grouping variables.\nmutate() and filter() are most useful in conjunction with window functions (like rank(), or min(x) == x). They are described in detail in vignette(“window-functions”).\nsample_n() and sample_frac() sample the specified number/fraction of rows in each group.\nsummarise() computes the summary for each group.\n\nIn our case, group_by() will used together with summarise() to derive the summarised data.frame.\n\nrealis2018_summarised &lt;- realis2018 %&gt;%\n  group_by(`Project Name`, `Planning Region`,\n           `Planning Area`, `Property Type`,\n           `Type of Sale`) %&gt;%\n  summarise(\n    `Total Unit Sold` = sum(`No. of Units`, na.rm = TRUE),\n    `Total Area` = sum(`Area (sqm)`, na.rm = TRUE),\n    `Median Unit Price ($ psm)` = median(`Unit Price ($ psm)`, na.rm = TRUE),\n    `Median Transacted Price` = median(`Transacted Price ($)`, na.rm = TRUE),\n    .groups = \"drop_last\"   # This keeps the last grouping level\n  )\n\nThe code chunk above shows a more efficient way to tackle the same processes by using the pipe, %&gt;%\n\nhead(realis2018_summarised)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 9\n# Groups:   Project Name, Planning Region, Planning Area, Property Type [6]\n  `Project Name`     `Planning Region` `Planning Area` `Property Type`      \n  &lt;chr&gt;              &lt;chr&gt;             &lt;chr&gt;           &lt;chr&gt;                \n1 # 1 LOFT           Central Region    Geylang         Apartment            \n2 # 1 SUITES         Central Region    Geylang         Apartment            \n3 1 CANBERRA         North Region      Yishun          Executive Condominium\n4 1 KING ALBERT PARK Central Region    Bukit Timah     Condominium          \n5 10 EVELYN          Central Region    Novena          Apartment            \n6 10 SHELFORD        Central Region    Bukit Timah     Apartment            \n# ℹ 5 more variables: `Type of Sale` &lt;chr&gt;, `Total Unit Sold` &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   `Total Area` &lt;dbl&gt;, `Median Unit Price ($ psm)` &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   `Median Transacted Price` &lt;dbl&gt;"

    "text": "In this section, treemap() of Treemap package is used to plot a treemap showing the distribution of median unit prices and total unit sold of resale condominium by geographic hierarchy in 2017.\nFirst, we will select records belongs to resale condominium property type from realis2018_selected data frame.\n\nrealis2018_selected &lt;- realis2018_summarised %&gt;%\n  filter(`Property Type` == \"Condominium\", `Type of Sale` == \"Resale\")\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below designed a treemap by using three core arguments of treemap(), namely: index, vSize and vColor.\n\ntreemap(realis2018_selected,\n        index=c(\"Planning Region\", \"Planning Area\", \"Project Name\"),\n        vSize=\"Total Unit Sold\",\n        vColor=\"Median Unit Price ($ psm)\",\n        title=\"Resale Condominium by Planning Region and Area, 2017\",\n        title.legend = \"Median Unit Price (S$ per sq. m)\"\n        )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThings to learn from the three arguments used:\n\nindex\n\nThe index vector must consist of at least two column names or else no hierarchy treemap will be plotted.\nIf multiple column names are provided, such as the code chunk above, the first name is the highest aggregation level, the second name the second highest aggregation level, and so on.\n\nvSize\n\nThe column must not contain negative values. This is because it’s vaues will be used to map the sizes of the rectangles of the treemaps.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nWarning:\nThe treemap above was wrongly coloured. For a correctly designed treemap, the colours of the rectagles should be in different intensity showing, in our case, median unit prices.\nFor treemap(), vColor is used in combination with the argument type to determines the colours of the rectangles. Without defining type, like the code chunk above, treemap() assumes type = index, in our case, the hierarchy of planning areas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntreemap(realis2018_selected,\n        index=c(\"Planning Region\", \"Planning Area\", \"Project Name\"),\n        vSize=\"Total Unit Sold\",\n        vColor=\"Median Unit Price ($ psm)\",\n        type = \"value\",\n        title=\"Resale Condominium by Planning Region and Area, 2017\",\n        title.legend = \"Median Unit Price (S$ per sq. m)\"\n        )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThinking to learn from the conde chunk above.\n\nThe rectangles are coloured with different intensity of green, reflecting their respective median unit prices.\nThe legend reveals that the values are binned into ten bins, i.e. 0-5000, 5000-10000, etc. with an equal interval of 5000.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe mapping and palette arguments control color assignment in treemaps. The key difference between \"value\" and \"manual\" lies in how colors are mapped to values:\n\n“value” mapping: Uses a diverging color palette (e.g., \"RdYlBu\") where 0 is assigned the middle color, negative values the left-end color, and positive values the right-end color based on their absolute range.\n“manual” mapping: Assigns the minimum value to the left-end color, the maximum to the right-end color, and the midpoint of the range to the middle color.\n\nEssentially, \"value\" emphasizes deviation from zero, while \"manual\" spreads colors evenly across the data range.\n\nThe “Value” TreeemapThe “Manual” Treemap\n\n\n\ntreemap(realis2018_selected,\n        index=c(\"Planning Region\", \"Planning Area\", \"Project Name\"),\n        vSize=\"Total Unit Sold\",\n        vColor=\"Median Unit Price ($ psm)\",\n        type=\"value\",\n        palette=\"RdYlBu\", \n        title=\"Resale Condominium by Planning Region and Area, 2017\",\n        title.legend = \"Median Unit Price (S$ per sq. m)\"\n        )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThing to learn from the code chunk above:\n\nalthough the colour palette used is RdYlBu but there are no red rectangles in the treemap above. This is because all the median unit prices are positive.\nThe reason why we see only 5000 to 45000 in the legend is because the range argument is by default c(min(values, max(values)) with some pretty rounding.\n\n\n\n\ntreemap(realis2018_selected,\n        index=c(\"Planning Region\", \"Planning Area\", \"Project Name\"),\n        vSize=\"Total Unit Sold\",\n        vColor=\"Median Unit Price ($ psm)\",\n        type=\"manual\",\n        palette=\"RdYlBu\", \n        title=\"Resale Condominium by Planning Region and Area, 2017\",\n        title.legend = \"Median Unit Price (S$ per sq. m)\"\n        )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThings to learn from the code chunk above:\n\nThe colour scheme used is very copnfusing. This is because mapping = (min(values), mean(range(values)), max(values)). It is not wise to use diverging colour palette such as RdYlBu if the values are all positive or negative\n\nTo overcome this problem, a single colour palette such as Blues should be used.\n\ntreemap(realis2018_selected,\n        index=c(\"Planning Region\", \"Planning Area\", \"Project Name\"),\n        vSize=\"Total Unit Sold\",\n        vColor=\"Median Unit Price ($ psm)\",\n        type=\"manual\",\n        palette=\"Blues\", \n        title=\"Resale Condominium by Planning Region and Area, 2017\",\n        title.legend = \"Median Unit Price (S$ per sq. m)\"\n        )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe treemap() function supports two layout algorithms: “squarified” and “pivotSize” (default).\n\n“squarified” (Bruls et al., 2000) optimizes aspect ratios for better readability but ignores the sorting order of rectangles.\n“pivotSize” (Bederson et al., 2002) maintains a reasonable aspect ratio while preserving the sorting order (sortID).\n\nEssentially, “squarified” prioritizes shape balance, while “pivotSize” ensures a meaningful order in the layout.\n\nAlgorithm ArgumentUsing SortID\n\n\n\ntreemap(realis2018_selected,\n        index=c(\"Planning Region\", \"Planning Area\", \"Project Name\"),\n        vSize=\"Total Unit Sold\",\n        vColor=\"Median Unit Price ($ psm)\",\n        type=\"manual\",\n        palette=\"Blues\", \n        algorithm = \"squarified\", #&lt;&lt;&lt;\n        title=\"Resale Condominium by Planning Region and Area, 2017\",\n        title.legend = \"Median Unit Price (S$ per sq. m)\"\n        )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen “pivotSize” algorithm is used, sortID argument can be used to dertemine the order in which the rectangles are placed from top left to bottom right.\n\ntreemap(realis2018_selected,\n        index=c(\"Planning Region\", \"Planning Area\", \"Project Name\"),\n        vSize=\"Total Unit Sold\",\n        vColor=\"Median Unit Price ($ psm)\",\n        type=\"manual\",\n        palette=\"Blues\", \n        algorithm = \"pivotSize\",\n        sortID = \"Median Transacted Price\",\n        title=\"Resale Condominium by Planning Region and Area, 2017\",\n        title.legend = \"Median Unit Price (S$ per sq. m)\"\n        )"
