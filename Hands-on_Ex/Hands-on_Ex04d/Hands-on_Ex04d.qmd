# **12  Funnel Plots for Fair Comparisons**

## **12.1 Overview**

Funnel plot is a specially designed data visualisation for conducting unbiased comparison between outlets, stores or business entities. By the end of this hands-on exercise, i have gain hands-on experience on:

-   plotting funnel plots by using **funnelPlotR** package,

-   plotting static funnel plot by using ggplot2 package, and

-   plotting interactive funnel plot by using both **plotly R** and **ggplot2** packages.

## Installing and Launching R packages

```{r}
#| warning: false
pacman::p_load(tidyverse, FunnelPlotR, plotly, knitr)
```

## Importing Data

```{r}
covid19 <- read_csv('data/COVID-19_DKI_Jakarta.csv',show_col_types = FALSE) %>% 
  mutate_if(is.character, as.factor)
covid19
```

## **12.4 FunnelPlotR methods**

[**FunnelPlotR**](https://nhs-r-community.github.io/FunnelPlotR/) package uses ggplot to generate funnel plots. It requires a `numerator` (events of interest), `denominator` (population to be considered) and `group`. The key arguments selected for customisation are:

-   `limit`: plot limits (95 or 99).

-   `label_outliers`: to label outliers (true or false).

-   `Poisson_limits`: to add Poisson limits to the plot.

-   `OD_adjust`: to add overdispersed limits to the plot.

-   `xrange` and `yrange`: to specify the range to display for axes, acts like a zoom function.

-   Other aesthetic components such as graph title, axis labels etc.

### **12.4.1 FunnelPlotR methods: The basic plot**

The code chunk below plots a funnel plot.

```{r}
funnel_plot(
  .data = covid19,
  numerator = Positive,
  denominator = Death,
  group = `Sub-district`
)
```

Things to learn from the code chunk above.

-   `group` in this function is different from the scatterplot. Here, it defines the level of the points to be plotted i.e. Sub-district, District or City. If Cityc is chosen, there are only six data points.

-   By default, `data_type`argument is “SR”.

-   `limit`: Plot limits, accepted values are: 95 or 99, corresponding to 95% or 99.8% quantiles of the distribution.

### **12.4.2 FunnelPlotR methods: Makeover 1**

This R code uses `FunnelPlotR` to create a **funnel plot**, where **Death** counts serve as the numerator and **Positive** cases as the denominator, grouped by **Sub-district**. The `data_type = "PR"` argument specifies proportions, while `xrange` and `yrange` set the X-axis (sample size) and Y-axis (proportion) limits.

```{r}
funnel_plot(
  .data = covid19,
  numerator = Death,
  denominator = Positive,
  group = `Sub-district`,
  data_type = "PR",     #<<
  xrange = c(0, 6500),  #<<
  yrange = c(0, 0.05)   #<<
)
```

-   **Adjusting Data Type**: The `data_type = "PR"` argument changes the default setting from **Standardized Ratios (SR)** to **Proportions (PR)**, making it suitable for this analysis.

-   **Setting Axis Ranges**: The `xrange = c(0, 6500)` defines the sample size range on the X-axis, while `yrange = c(0, 0.05)` restricts the Y-axis to relevant proportions for better readability.

-   **Visualizing Overdispersion**: The plot includes **95% and 99.8% confidence limits**, helping identify areas where sub-districts deviate significantly from expected mortality rates.

Things to learn from the code chunk above. + `data_type` argument is used to change from default “SR” to “PR” (i.e. proportions). + `xrange` and `yrange` are used to set the range of x-axis and y-axis

### **12.4.3 FunnelPlotR methods: Makeover 2**

The code chunk below plots a funnel plot.

```{r}
funnel_plot(
  .data = covid19,
  numerator = Death,
  denominator = Positive,
  group = `Sub-district`,
  data_type = "PR",   
  xrange = c(0, 6500),  
  yrange = c(0, 0.05),
  label = NA,
  title = "Cumulative COVID-19 Fatality Rate by Cumulative Total Number of COVID-19 Positive Cases", #<<           
  x_label = "Cumulative COVID-19 Positive Cases", #<<
  y_label = "Cumulative Fatality Rate"  #<<
)
```

Things to learn from the code chunk above.

-   `label = NA` argument is to removed the default label outliers feature.

-   `title` argument is used to add plot title.

-   `x_label` and `y_label` arguments are used to add/edit x-axis and y-axis titles.

## **12.5 Funnel Plot for Fair Visual Comparison: ggplot2 methods**

In this section, i have gained hands-on experience on building funnel plots step-by-step by using ggplot2. It aims to enhance you working experience of ggplot2 to customise speciallised data visualisation like funnel plot.

### **12.5.1 Computing the basic derived fields**

To plot the funnel plot from scratch, we need to derive cumulative death rate and standard error of cumulative death rate.

```{r}
df <- covid19 %>%
  mutate(rate = Death / Positive) %>%
  mutate(rate.se = sqrt((rate*(1-rate)) / (Positive))) %>%
  filter(rate > 0)

```

```{r}
fit.mean <- weighted.mean(df$rate, 1/df$rate.se^2)
```

### **12.5.2 Calculate lower and upper limits for 95% and 99.9% CI**

The code chunk below is used to compute the lower and upper limits for 95% confidence interval.

```{r}
number.seq <- seq(1, max(df$Positive), 1)
number.ll95 <- fit.mean - 1.96 * sqrt((fit.mean*(1-fit.mean)) / (number.seq)) 
number.ul95 <- fit.mean + 1.96 * sqrt((fit.mean*(1-fit.mean)) / (number.seq)) 
number.ll999 <- fit.mean - 3.29 * sqrt((fit.mean*(1-fit.mean)) / (number.seq)) 
number.ul999 <- fit.mean + 3.29 * sqrt((fit.mean*(1-fit.mean)) / (number.seq)) 
dfCI <- data.frame(number.ll95, number.ul95, number.ll999, 
                   number.ul999, number.seq, fit.mean)
```

-   **Confidence Interval (CI) Calculation**: Uses **1.96** and **3.29** as critical values from the standard normal distribution to compute the **95% and 99.9%** confidence interval limits.

-   **Standard Error Based on Binomial Distribution**: `sqrt((fit.mean * (1 - fit.mean)) / number.seq)` calculates the **standard error for a binomial distribution**, which measures the uncertainty in the estimate.

-   **Creating a Data Frame (`dfCI`)**: Organizes the **lower and upper bounds of the 95% and 99.9% confidence intervals, the sample sequence (`number.seq`), and the mean (`fit.mean`)** into a `data.frame` for further visualization or analysis.

### **12.5.3 Plotting a static funnel plot**

In the code chunk below, ggplot2 functions are used to plot a static funnel plot.

```{r}
p <- ggplot(df, aes(x = Positive, y = rate)) +
  geom_point(aes(label=`Sub-district`), 
             alpha=0.4) +
  geom_line(data = dfCI, 
            aes(x = number.seq, 
                y = number.ll95), 
            size = 0.4, 
            colour = "grey40", 
            linetype = "dashed") +
  geom_line(data = dfCI, 
            aes(x = number.seq, 
                y = number.ul95), 
            size = 0.4, 
            colour = "grey40", 
            linetype = "dashed") +
  geom_line(data = dfCI, 
            aes(x = number.seq, 
                y = number.ll999), 
            size = 0.4, 
            colour = "grey40") +
  geom_line(data = dfCI, 
            aes(x = number.seq, 
                y = number.ul999), 
            size = 0.4, 
            colour = "grey40") +
  geom_hline(data = dfCI, 
             aes(yintercept = fit.mean), 
             size = 0.4, 
             colour = "grey40") +
  coord_cartesian(ylim=c(0,0.05)) +
  annotate("text", x = 1, y = -0.13, label = "95%", size = 3, colour = "grey40") + 
  annotate("text", x = 4.5, y = -0.18, label = "99%", size = 3, colour = "grey40") + 
  ggtitle("Cumulative Fatality Rate by Cumulative Number of COVID-19 Cases") +
  xlab("Cumulative Number of COVID-19 Cases") + 
  ylab("Cumulative Fatality Rate") +
  theme_light() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size=12),
        legend.position = c(0.91,0.85), 
        legend.title = element_text(size=7),
        legend.text = element_text(size=7),
        legend.background = element_rect(colour = "grey60", linetype = "dotted"),
        legend.key.height = unit(0.3, "cm"))
p
```

### **12.5.4 Interactive Funnel Plot: plotly + ggplot2**

The funnel plot created using ggplot2 functions can be made interactive with `ggplotly()` of **plotly** r package.

```{r}
fp_ggplotly <- ggplotly(p,
  tooltip = c("label", 
              "x", 
              "y"))
fp_ggplotly
```
